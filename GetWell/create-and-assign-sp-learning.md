## Overview
Course assignments are a great way to provide self-paced training to a users. They allow you to give access to course activities and resources to learners, and allow the learners to move at their own pace and the ability to engage with course materials on their own terms, without the constraints of a traditional classroom setting. Users can take and re-take the training as long as the course assignment is valid. This means they can revisit the course content and reinforce their knowledge whenever needed.
Here's everything you need to know about course assignments and how you can allocate them as a TMS administrator.

When you create a course assignment, your learner has immediate access to the course to start their hands on learning. By default, the assignment expires in 180 days from the creation date, this time period is set based on the maximum days of access for a course assignment as defined in your organization or course profile. The expiration time period may be shortened when creating or editing assignments.

Course assignments are billed based on their creation date. However, if your learner hasn't launched any labs within 24 hours of creating the assignment, you have the option to cancel it.

## Use training keys to allocate course assignments to learners
In the world of online learning, it's important to have efficient methods for allocating training. One such method is to utilizing training key pools, which provide a win for both administrators and users. 

A training key pool allows administrators to distribute keys to users, these keys enable the learners to create their own self-paced course assignments. Each key in the pool is exclusive to a specific course assignment and learner. When a user redeems a key, it automatically generates their assigned course; it can also be used to self-register them in the TMS to create their own user account if the login page for the site has the Redeem Training Key field enabled. This empowers users to take charge of their training journey while ensuring they stay on the right track.

By utilizing training key pools, administrators can effectively manage and distribute course assignments to learners. Training key pools have many benefits, they make the creation of users and course assignment more efficient by allowing administrators to distribute keys to multiple users for the same course; the key can be used only once to create one assignment. You have the ability to set the duration of access to course content for students. Pools have no limit on the number of keys that can be created so you can easily generate new keys and add them to the existing pool.

Learners can take and re-take the training as long as the course assignment is valid. This means they can revisit the course content and reinforce their knowledge whenever needed. Training key pools empower users to take charge of their training journey and learn at their own pace.

### Create a Training Key Pool
A Training key pool key is used for individual self-paced course assignments and each pool is specific to one course. Keys can only be redeemed while pools are active, this is based on the pool's Starts and Expires fields. There is no limit to the number of keys that can be generated and once created the keys can be exported for distribution.

**To create a training key pool**,
1.	On the Site Administration page on the **Training Keys** tile click **Create Training Key Pool**, this redirects you to the Create Training Key Pool page.

**Decide the characteristics of your pool**
1.	In the **Name** field input a name for the training key pool.
1.	Beside the **Course** field click **Choose** to open the Course Chooser dialog and select the course to align the pool with, then click **OK**.
1.	In the **Start**s field, **input a date**, this controls when the keys can start being redeemed.
1.	In the **Expire**s field, **input a date**, this specifies when the keys can no longer be redeemed. This can be useful if a new version of the course is soon to be available and you want to ensure that keys for the older version are no longer used.
1.	Set the **Content Availability**, this sets the time period the learner can access the course from when the key is redeemed creating the assignment.
1.	Optional: Select the box next to **Make these keys available to everyone using [Organization name]** to allow keys in this pool to be used by child organizations within the parent organization that owns this pool.

**Add your keys**

Switch to the Training Keys tab. Here, you have three options:
* Manually enter each individual key by clicking **Add Training Key**.
* Click **Add Multiple Training Keys** to paste your training keys, one per line, in the pop-up dialog.
* Click **Generate Training Keys**, then enter the number of keys in the field provided and click OK.

**Save your work**
1.	Once all the keys have been created, click **Save**.

After saving you are redirected to the newly created Training Key Pool page with all the keys displayed and keys may be exported using the link. The pool can be edited to create more key or update its Starts or Expires dates to manage access to the keys. Keys display along with their creation date and once redeemed they also show the redemption date and the user. 

### Distribute keys to learners
Once keys are generated, you will need to distribute them to your learners. You can export the keys from the pool to track your distribution of the keys. 

When it comes to registering students for self-paced training with training keys, it's important to guide them through the process of creating their own user accounts and provisioning their training. Below, you will find the email template that provides step-by-step instructions on how your students can redeem their training keys and access their labs.

## Learner's access to their training
To ensure a smooth learning experience, it is important for learners to easily access their course assignments. In our TMS learners can access their training through multiple avenues, including the dashboard, the current training page, and their transcript.

### Accessing Course Assignments from the Dashboard
The dashboard serves as the default landing page for students and provides a central hub for accessing all their training including course assignments. When learners access the dashboard, they will see the top five most relevant course assignments displayed. To open a course assignment, simply click on it.

In cases where there are more than five active courses to display, an arrow will appear on the right side of the widget. Clicking this arrow will navigate learners to the Current Training page's Course Assignments section.
It's important to note that the Dashboard widget automatically refreshes every 5 minutes, ensuring learners have the most up-to-date information.

### Accessing Course Assignments from the Current Training page
Learners can access their course assignments by visiting the Current Training or My Training page. If Course Assignments are not expired and are not started or incomplete, they will display a list at the top of the page. 

To open a specific Course Assignment, learners simply need to click on the name of the course. By doing so, they will be able to access all the activities and labs associated with that course.

### Launching labs from completed assignments 
If a Course Assignment has been completed by a learner, it will no longer be visible on the Current Training page. However, learners can still find completed assignments on both their dashboard and their transcript. Even after completing a course assignment, you still have the ability to launch new instances of the labs associated with it, as long as the expiration date has not passed. This means you can continue practicing and refining your skills even after the assignment is completed. As long as the course assignment is active, learners can launch all the content associated with the completed assignment from either the Dashboard or the Transcript.

### Transcript
Once you have completed a course assignment, it will be moved to your Transcript page. Here, you can keep track of all your completed assignments and courses in one place. To access a completed course assignment, simply click on My Transcript on the navigation bar.

### Certificates of completion
If a completion certificate is available for the course and you have successfully completed the assignment, you have the option to print your certificate. You can easily do this from the Transcript page by clicking on the certificate icon next to your course assignment opening a printable PDF. This allows you to showcase your achievements and celebrate your progress.

### Badges and achievements
If a badge or an achievement has be rewarded to the learner they can view them in two places, from the **Achievements** link on the User Profile or from the Dashboard's **Rewards** section. When badges are awarded an email is sent to the user giving them the choice to share the badge through social media.
