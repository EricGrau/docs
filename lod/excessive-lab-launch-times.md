# Excessive Lab Launch Times

When a lab is launched, an attempt is made, to place the lab in the datacenter closest to your location. However, depending on a variety of factors including storage availability, regional demand,or scheduled maintenance windows, a given lab launch may be placed in a datacenter further away. When this happens, the lab will go to the next available region.

If the datacenter closest to your location is available but certain lab files need to be obtained from a neighboring datacenter, the launch may be delayed to ensure all necessary lab files have finished provisioning. This loading time may vary based on size and amount of files that must be provisioned.

If you believe that your lab has taken an excessive amount of time to launch, we recommend performing the following the steps in our [Cancel Running Lab](cancel-running-lab.md) document to attempt a relaunch. If you have a similar issue upon a relaunch of your lab please reach out to your learning provider for assistance.
