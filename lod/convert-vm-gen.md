## Capture Disk Changes

1. Launch the lab profile that contains the virtual machine (VM) that you would like to convert from Generation 1 to Generation 2.
1. Log in to the VM. 
1. Right click on the **Start button**, and select **PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. Enter the following command and wait for it to finish

### Hard Disks

On the Hard Disks tab of the Create Virtual Machine Profile page: 
1. Select **+ Add Hard Disk**. 
1. Navigate to the **directory where the vhdx files are** for this VM.
1. Add the **Base Disk**. 
 
>[!Knowledge] This will be the disk that contains the original file name **without** a hyphen followed by trailing numbers and additional hyphens before the _.vhdx_ filetype extension.

#### Add Differencing Disks 

Next, add each differencing disk one at a time, in sequential order (starting from the disk ending in _-01.vhdx_ to the largest) attached to this base disk. 

1. Select **+ Add Disk**. 
1. Add the first disk. 
1. Repeat the previous step, and add each disk, one at a time, in sequential order. 

The last differencing disk will be the save you captured after running the `mbr2gpt` command, in previous steps.

## Attach New VM Profle to a Lab Profile

1. Navigate to the Lab Profile you would like to attach your new Gen 2 Hyper-V VM to. 
1. Select the **Edit Settings link** on the top right corner of the page. 

In the Edit Lab Profile settings page:

 1. Navigate to the **Virtual Machines tab**.
 1. **(Optional)** Select the _X_ in the top right corner of the VM's card to remove unwanted VM(s).
 1. Select **+ Add Virtual Machines** in the bottom left corner.

    ![Attach Gen2 VM to Lab Profile](images/attach-gen2vm-to-lab-profilie.png)

1. Search for the **Generation 2 VM you created in previous steps** and add it to the Lab Profile. 

1. Select Save and leave a note to describe the changes that you are making to the **Lab Profile**.
