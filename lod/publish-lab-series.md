# Publishing a Lab Series

The instructions below are for the most direct way to publish a new Lab Series, that is in Development to Production. This procedure should be used anytime that a new course is being published to production.

> If a course has been updated in Development and the requirement is for the updated course to replace the previous production version of a course, please refer to the [Lab Profile Inheritance documentation](lab-profile-inheritance.md). 
>
>request the Parent/child document which discusses how the updated profile is published to production and then linked to the existing Lab Profile, so the Lab Profile ID stays the same and there is no need for modification within a customerâ€™s LMS.

## Saving a New Lab Series

After you have finished development on a lab series in Lab on Demand, complete the following steps to publish to production. 

1. **Navigate** to the **Lab Series** that you want to publish to production. 

1. **Select Edit** in the upper-right corner of the page. 

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and **Select Save As**. 

1. On the Save As dialog, specify the following: 

    1. Enter a **name** for the new Lab Series.
    1. Next to the **Organization** field, **select** the **Choose** button, then select the production organization that will own the Lab Series. 
    1. **Select** the **Lab Profiles** that will be saved to the new production Lab Series. This can be any combination of Lab Profiles in the list, or you may choose **Select All** to add all Lab Profiles in the list to the new production Lab Series. 

## Launch Lab Profiles and Set Development Status

Next, you must launch each Lab Profile one time to confirm that they launch and function as expected, and then set the Development Status to _Complete_. 

1. Navigate to the first Lab Profile in the new Lab Series. 

1. Launch the lab and confirm it launches and functions as expected. Once it is launched and you have confirmed it works as expected, end the lab from within the launched lab. 

1. **Edit** the Lab profile, and **Select** the drop-down menu next to the **Development Status** field. 

1. Change this to **Complete**. 

1. **Save** the Lab Profile. 

1. Repeat these steps for each Lab Profile in the Lab Series. 

## Publishing the Lab Series to Production

Once you have launched each Lab Profile in the Lab Series, and set the development status to _Complete_, you may publish the Lab series to an API Consumer. 

1. **Navigate** to the **new Lab Series**

1. **Select Edit** in the upper-right corner of the page. 

1. **Select** the **Publish** tab of the Lab Series. 

1. **Select Add API Consumer**. 

    1. Search for the API Consumer for your organization or if you are publishing to the Training Management System (TMS), search for _Training Management System_ and add that API Consumer. 

1. Click **Save** on the **Lab Series**.

1. Add a note about publishing the Lab Series. It is recommended to list the API Consumers that the Lab Series was published to during this step. 

You will now be able to launch the new production Lab Profile(s) via the API Consumers that the Lab Series was published to. You can find the new Lab Profile ID(s) under the new Lab Series, to configure in your API calls.
