## Organization Account creation

An account must be created in your organization. This account will be used to launch an AWS VM when a user launches a lab. 

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) with your root account credentials.
2. Go to **My Organization** from the menu in the upper-right corner of the page.
3. Click **Add Account**.

3. On the **Authentication tab**, configure the following:

	![Create subscription - Authentication](images/create-subscription-authentication.png){400}
	
	1. Check the box to **Override Pool Authentication**. Selecting this will use the authentication information on the subscription instead of the authentication information on the subscription pool.
	1. Enter the Catch All Domain that was used during organization account creation. 
	1. Enter the Access Key ID that was generated during IAM user account creation. 
	1. Enter the Access key Secret that was generated during IAM user account creation. 
	
## Virtual Machine Prep

You must export your virtual machine to a VHD and upload to AWS to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). 

The virtual machine needs to be prepared: 

1. Launch your virtual machine. 

1. On your Virtual machine, there are 2 settings that need to be configured before exporting to a VHD.
	- Enable DHCP
	- Enable RDP 

1. Capture a final differencing disk of the virtual machine. 

1. Export VM to VHD format. 

## Upload VHD to AWS and Create AMI

1. If the exported VM resulted in multiple VHDs, merge the disk chain into a single VHD. 

1. Using the log in credentials created in [previous steps](#organization-account-creation), then log in to the AWS portal. 

1. In the AWS portal, create an S3 bucket. 

1. On your local machine, [install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html). If you already have AWS CLI installed, ensure it is up to date. 

1. Create a JSON file with specific information for image import into AWS.

1. Reference the JSON file and run the import command using [this AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html).

1. Note the **job number** that is associated with the command. You must wait until it is noted as **Complete before continuing to the next steps**. 

1. After the job is completed, go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in to the account where the AMI was created. 

1. Go to the **EC2** page in the AWS Management Console. 

1. On the left side of the page, click **AMIs** under the Images section. 

1. Select the new AMI that you created. 

1. Right-click AMI and select **Launch**. 

1. Select the **Instance** type and **size** for the machine.

1. Click **Review and Launch**.

1. Allow the VM to start, then **connect via RDP**. 

	>[!knowledge] The VM may take a few minutes for resource usage to stabilize. 

1. **Exit the RDP window**, but leave the VM running. 

1. Go back to the **EC2** page in the AWS Management Console, and click **Instances** on the left-side of the page under the Instances section. 

1. **Select the Instance** for the AMI that you launched. 

1. **Right-click** the Instance and select **Capture new AMI image**. 

1. After the image finishes capturing, go back to the AMIs section and **click AMIs**. 

1. **Select the new AMI image** that was just created after capturing an AMI image. 

1. Change the name of the AMI to a more friendly name, be specific. 

1. The AMI needs to be shared with all accounts that will be used to launch the VM. 

	1. Select the AMI. 

	1. Click the **Permissions** tab near the bottom of the page. 

	1. Click **Edit**. 

	1. Enter any account numbers that should be given permission to launch the AMI, and then click **Add Permission**. Account numbers can only be entered one at a time. 

	1. After all account numbers are added, click **Save**. 

The AMi can now be configured in a Lab on Demand lab profile. 

## VM Profile Creation

1. Go to [Lab on Demand](https://labondemand.com). 

1. From the Admin page, click **Create Virtual Machine Profile** from the Virtual Machines tile. 

	![Create virtual machine profile](images/create-virtual-machine-profile.png){400}
	
1. Complete the following fields on the VM profile: 
 
	![](images/create-virtual-machine-profile-basic-information.png){600}
	
	- Name: use the same friendly name that was used for the AMI in the AWS management console. 
	- Description: describe the intended use of the VM.
