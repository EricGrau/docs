# MCA 

## Overview
The CSS logic in Skillable Studio has been updated to use the MCA billing API. All new CSS pools need to be created in the MCA tenant, however, this process is not as simple as it once was when using the EA. The MCA Billing API requires working with a Billing Account as the top level management group for subscriptions, and you can have only one Billing Account per MCA tenant. This prevents logically separating QA/UAT/Prod/Customer subscription pools easily like the EA used to be able to do.
 
It should first be seriously determined if a new tenant is required when a request for a new pool comes in, as each net new tenant requires a new MCA agreement to be generated by our Azure CSM, signed with the master login unique to that tenant, and configured in LOD. There is NO centralized billing management interface for the MCA to aggregate billing and costs between all MCAs, so management of each starts to become unscalable as we add tenants. It is best to utilize the existing tenants we have before creating any new ones.
 
## MCA generation
1. If a new MCA tenant is required, create the new tenant, using a new local login as the global admin for that tenant. See the existing master accounts in LastPass for reference on naming.
1. Reach out to your Azure CSM to generate a new MCA for the tenant that was created and the new account username that was created. 
    >[!note] This may take several days to receive. 

1. When she returns the MCA for signing, MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SIGNED IN WITH THE ACCOUNT YOU CREATED BEFORE ACCEPTING. This binds the MCA to that account, and you can only have 1 MCA per Azure AD User globally.

### Create a Cloud Slice App  

Create a cloud-slice-app enterprise application for LOD management of subscriptions. This process is the same as the EA CSS creation.
o	Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications -> + New Application -> Create your own application -> name application -> Create
o	Navigate to App Registrations in Azure AD and select the cloud-slice-app you've created.
1. Select Certificates & Secrets and generate a client secret for LOD to use, taking note of the value of the secret you generate. Store this in LastPass
 
## MCA CSS Pool creation
1. Sign into the MCA tenant with the local global admin account you created, and navigate to the "Cost Management + Billing" Section.
1. Select the Billing Account for the MCA you've just created, example:
 
    ![Select Billing Account](images/select-billing-account.png)
 
1. Navigate to Access Control (IAM) and add the cloud-slice-app and any users that you need to have management access to the billing scope, example:

1. In LOD, create a new cloud subscription pool, filling out the values on each tab. Example:
 
1. Validate subscription provisioning. This can take some time for the initial process to kick off.
