# How Do I Extend The Amount Of Time On The Lab Timer?

Each running lab has a timer in the upper right corner showing you the amount of time left before the lab will be cancelled or saved. A lab is cancelled if no activity was performed in lab; it is saved and closed if saving is allowed for the lab. Most, but not all, labs can have their times extended. 

When there is less than 10 minutes remaining, a pop-up window will appear asking if you would like to extend your lab. Click **Yes** to extend the lab by 15 minutes. This allows the lab to be extended up to the maximum time allotted for the lab.

>[!alert] It is not usually possible to extend your time when working in an exam, performance based test, or challenge.
