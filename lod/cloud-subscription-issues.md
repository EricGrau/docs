# Cloud Subscription Issues

Microsoft Azure Cloud Slice Subscription (CSS) labs provide an environment that allows training on Microsoft Azure and gives the lab user access to administrative settings in the Azure subscription. Subscriptions are provided to the lab environment and accessed using login credentials. These login credentials will provide access and permissions to access Azure, for completion of the labs steps. Due to frequent changes in Microsoft Azure all subscriptions are set with an expiration, this ensures that permissions are up to date. 

If you experience issues with your Cloud Slice Access during your lab instance, please reach out to your training provider with the following information: 

- CSS Credentials provided
- Lab instance ID
- Errors presented/screenshots of errors if available
