# Overview

Lab on Demand allows you to set Azure DevOps (ADO) or GitHub as an instruction source, using an external ADO or GitHub repository into a lab and use that repository as the source of IDLx content for that lab. 

Choosing to leverage these features means moving all of your content management (including editing) for a lab into ADO or GitHub. Once you have enabled this instruction source for a lab, the content in that lab will automatically be updated
based on the the latest changes you make to your content in the external repository. 

There is a small learning curve to overcome with Markdown such as syntax and structure; however, the benefits you will realize once you have
learned how to write your lab content in Markdown and once you have stored those files in GitHub are well worth the effort. For more information on Markdown, see our [Markdown User Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnOnDemandSystems/docs/master/guides/idl2/markdown-user-guide.md)

## External Management Benefits

1. **Offline editing** - With external instruction management, content is created/edited as part of a structured Markdown file, that can be edited offline using one of the many free or commercial Markdown editors that are available for all mainstream platforms/devices being used today, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
1. **Revision control** - ADO and GitHub natively support revision control, which means you get revision control for your content in labs that leverage the integration feature. This allows you to compare revisions, roll back changes, view revision history, etc.
1. **Multi-author support** - By managing your content in a lab that leverages external instruction source, you can support multiple content authors contributing to the content for one lab at the same time.

## External Management Disadvantages

1. **LOD Custom Syntax Unavailable in External Repository** - when using an external repository as an instruction source, custom LOD markdown syntax is will not render in the external system. These markdown elements can still be used and rendered in a lab.  
These include: 
    - Knowledge block/link
    - Alert block/link
    - Help block/link
    - Hint block/link
    - Note block
    - Copyable text
    - Type text
    - code block modifiers
    - @lab replacement tokens Intellisense


1. **Activities** - Automated and question activities are unavailable when using an external repository as an instruction source. 

## Best Practices
 
 When using an external instruction source, there are a few things to consider. 

 - The overall size of the repository cannot exceed 500MB.

 - Keep your repository as small as possible. Large repositories can possibly present problems. For example, if your repo is approaching the size limit and then multiple commits are made very quickly, some of the commits may not be displayed in the lab instructions.

 - We highly recommend using repositories dedicated to your lab content and not mixing other content within these repositories.
    
- You are able to host content for multiple lab profiles within the same repository, but keep in mind you could eventually need to break this up into multiple repositories if the lab content exceeds the maximum file size per repo. A good rule of thumb would be one repository per course or lab series. 

# Getting started

For external instruction sources, you will need to have an account on the selected platform and will be prompted to login. If
you do not have one yet, you can create an account:

- [Azure DevOps (ADO)](#azure-devops)
- [GitHub](#github)

Your repository will need a markdown (.md) file that defines the lab content in Markdown. This file will contain the lab instructions for your lab, formatted in Markdown. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] Any images that are used in the instructions need to be at the same level in the repository as the .md file, or in a folder that is at the same level as the .md file. If your images are not structured like this, they will not display correctly in labs. 

When you configure a lab profile to use an external instruction source, you will be directed to an external login page, where you will be asked to allow Lab On Demand permission to access your repositories. Lab On Demand will need access to your email address for push notifications, repository access, and admin permissions to modify web hooks.

> [!Alert] The overall size of the repository cannot exceed 500MB. Once the repo reaches the file size limit, the lab profile will stop syncing with the repository until the repository size is below the file size limit. 

## Azure DevOps

If you do not have an ADO account set up yet, you can [create an account here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?).

1. Create a new ADO repository where you will manage your lab content.
1. Create a folder to store your lab instructions and any other files used in the lab.
1. Create a new file in the folder called content.md.
1. If you want to store screenshots for your lab in ADO, create a _media_ folder, inside of the folder created on step 2.
1. If you want to store videos for your lab in ADO, these can be stored in the _media_ folder as well.

If you are moving content for a lab that has
content into ADO, see the [Copying Existing Lab Content into GitHub](copying-existing-content) section below to start that way instead.

> [!KNOWLEDGE] You can manage more than one lab profile from a single ADO repository, by separating the lab profiles with folders in your repository. 

To use the markdown document in your ADO repository as the instruction source with a lab profile, navigate to the lab profile you want to configure, then follow these steps:

1. From your lab profile page, click **Edit**.

1. Click on the **Advanced tab**, then click **Instruction Source**.

    ![](images/instruction-source.png)

1. Select **ADO Repository**.

1. If you're not logged in already, you be will prompted to log in to the ADO account that has a repository containing lab content you want to use as an instruction source in the lab profile.

1. Once you are logged into ADO, you will be asked to authorize Lab on Demand to have access to your ADO account. This access is only used to create a webhook so that LOD can be notified whenever the content in your ADO repository changes. Click **Accept** to continue with the integration.

<!--
    ![Authorize application](images/ado-authorization.png "Authorize application")
-->

1. At this point you will be presented with a list of organizations that are associated with your ADO account. Click select next the organization containing the project file to be used as the instructions source. 

1. Select the ADO project that contains your repository.

1. Select the repository containing the markdown file to be used as the instructions source. Repositories without proper permissions will not be displayed.

    > [!ALERT] When you complete the following step, any existing content in your lab profile will be overwritten, and anything lost will be unrecoverable. If you have content in the lab profile, you can export the lab instructions by clicking the export button at the top of the lab profile details page. 

1. Select the markdown file to be used as the instructions source. Once you select the Markdown file that defines the lab content, LOD will process all lab content referenced by that markdown file and add it into the lab profile instructions. At any point that the ADO content changes, the lab profile will be updated automatically.

1. Once the synchronization process is complete, you will have completed your integration. Click **Close** to finish the Integration wizard.

1. Your lab profile now shows that instructions are sourced from your ADO repository. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of your lab profile window to exit the lab profile editor.

## GitHub 

If you do not have a GitHub account set up yet, you can [create an account here](https://github.com).

1. Create a new GitHub repository where you will manage your lab content.
1. Create a folder to store your lab instructions and any other files used in the lab.
1. Create a new file in the folder called content.md.
1. If you want to store screenshots for your lab in GitHub, create a _media_ folder, inside of the folder created on step 2.
1. If you want to store videos for your lab in GitHub, these can be stored in the _media_ folder as well.

If you are moving content for a lab that has
content into GitHub, see the **Copying Existing Lab Content into GitHub** section below to start that way instead.

> [!KNOWLEDGE] You can manage more than one lab profile from a single GitHub repository, by separating the lab profiles with folders in your repository. 

To use the markdown document in your GitHub repository as the instruction source with a lab profile, navigate to the lab profile you want to configure, then follow these steps:

1. From your lab profile page, click **Edit**.

1. Click on the **Advanced tab**, then click **Instruction Source**.

    ![](images/instruction-source.png)

1. Select **GitHub Repository**.

If you're not logged in already, you be will prompted to log in to the GitHub account that has a repository containing lab content you want to use as an instruction source in the lab profile.

1. Once you are logged into GitHub, you will be asked to authorize Lab on Demand to have access to your GitHub account. This access is only used to create a webhook so that LOD can be notified whenever the
content in your GitHub repository changes. Click **Authorize application** to
continue with the integration.

<!--
    ![Authorize application](images/04-authorize-application.png "Authorize application")
-->

1. At this point you will be presented with a list of repositories that are associated with your GitHub account. Click select next the repository containing the markdown file to be used as the instructions source. 

    > [!ALERT] When you complete the following step, any existing content in your lab profile will be overwritten, and anything lost will be unrecoverable. If you have content in the lab profile, you can export the lab instructions by clicking the export button at the top of the lab profile details page. 

1. After choosing your repository, you need to identify the markdown file that defines the lab content within that repository. Click **Select** next to the markdown file to use as the source of your lab content.

1. Once you select the Markdown file that defines the lab content, LOD will process all lab content referenced by that markdown file and add it into the lab profile instructions. At any point that the GitHub content changes, the lab profile will be updated automatically.

1. Once the synchronization process is complete, you will have completed your
integration. Click **Close** to finish the Integration wizard.

1.Your lab profile now shows that instructions are sourced from your GitHub repository. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of your lab profile window to exit the lab profile editor.

### Copying Existing Lab Content

If you have a lab that already has IDLx content in LOD, you can use ADO or GitHub to manage that content as well. To get this set up you must do the following:

1. In Lab on Demand, navigate to the lab profile whose content you want to
manage in GitHub.

1. Click **Export**.

    ![Click the Export link](images/01-export.png "Click the Export link")

1. In the **Export** window, select **Lab Metadata: Instructions Only** and click
**OK**.

    ![Select IDL Content Only](images/02-content-only.png "Select Lab Metadata: IDL Content Only")

1. In the **Save** dialog, navigate to the location where you want to save the archive file.

The archive file that is saved will contain a content.md file as well as folders for screenshots and videos if either of these were present in the original lab profile. Add these files to the ADO or GitHub repository that you want to use to manage your lab content, and then proceed to the configure the lab profile to use an external instruction source for [ADO](#azure-devops) or [GitHub](#github)
