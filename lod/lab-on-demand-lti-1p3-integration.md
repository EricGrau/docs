# Lab on Demand LTI 1.3 Integration

Skillable is now [LTI Advantage Complete certified.](https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/learn-demand-systems/lab-demand) LTI v1.3 allows external course authors to integrate rich Lab on Demand (LOD) content directly into their learning management system (LMS) in a standard way. For the purposes of this documentation, please note that the LMS being used by a student is referred to as the Platform, and the external tool or service (LOD) that the LMS is integrated with is referred to as the Tool.

To integrate content from a **Tool** into a **Platform**, the following information is required:

The Tool will be responsible for supplying the following.
- **LTI 1.3 Login / Connect Url** - this URL is used for initially authenticate between the Tool and Platform.
- **LTI Redirect URL / Launch URL** - this URL serves two purposes. It is used to validate the information passed between the provider and consumer. It also serves as the target URL or launch URL for the labs. You may need to enter this twice into two separate fields depending on the Platform you are using.
- **JWKS URL / PEM Public Key** - Lab On Demand supports LTI 1.3 authentication by issuing either a JWKS or PEM formatted public key. Please let us know which Platform you are using if you are unsure which authentication method to request.
- **LTI 1.3 DeepLink Url** - Used as the target link for Deep Link Launches. (Must be supported by the LMS)

Once the above information is entered into a Platform, the following information will be returned by the Platform and should be shared with Lab On Demand admin.

- **Client ID** - this is used to identify the Platform in the Lab On Demand tool.
- **Issuer** - this is the base URL of the Platform and is found on the certificate used to sign LTI request. 
- **Auth URL** - the URL used during the OIDC authorization call.
- **JWKS URL** - the endpoint hosting the JWKS used for signing LTI request.
- **Access Token URL** - the endpoint used to exchange the requested OAuth2 access token during authorization.

## Replacement Tokens

Select LTI 1.3 claims are available as replacement tokens in labs. The list of Available claims and tokens include(case sensitive):
- Context_id = @lab.Variable(LtiContextId)
- Context_label = @lab.Variable(LtiContextLabel)
- Context_title = @lab.Variable(LtiContextTitle)
- Roles = @lab.Variable(LtiRoles)

## LTI Scoring

Labs initialized through the platform and running in the Lab on Demand tool may return a score to the platform upon completion.
The scoring can be broken up into two categories, Per Exam level scoring and Per Activity level scoring. Please be sure to specify if you are interested in implementing either scoring option when requesting an API LTI consumer.

- **Per Exam Level Scoring** - when using per exam level scoring, the number of points earned during a lab is returned as a total number of points.
- **Per Activity Level Scoring** - when using per activity level scoring, the results will be more granular. A line item score will be returned for each activity configured in the lab profile. Additionally, the  total number of points earned will also be sent.

>[!knowledge] An optional feature can send the output returned by each individual activity. Please let us know if you are interested in this feature when requesting an API LTI consumer.
