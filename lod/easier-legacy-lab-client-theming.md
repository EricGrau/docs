## Overview

The Easier Legacy Lab Client Theming feature introduces two primary changes to the existing themes model:

1.  Real-time Theme Updates: You can now make changes to the theme's CSS and scripts without requiring a full form submission. This allows for more real-time editing and immediate visualization of the theme changes.

1.  Theme Inheritance: With theme inheritance, you can easily inherit styles and scripts from other themes. This eliminates the need for excessive copy-pasting, making it more efficient to create customized themes that build upon existing ones.

## Editing Themes in Real-time

To make real-time changes to a theme, follow these steps:

1.  Log in as an administrator and ensure you have access to a running lab.
1.  Open a separate browser tab or window to edit the theme that the lab uses.
1.  Modify the theme settings, including CSS and scripts, as desired.
1.  Save the changes without the need for a full form submission.
1.  Refresh the lab in your browser.
1.  You will now see the updated theme applied in the lab, reflecting the changes you made.

This real-time editing capability allows you to fine-tune the theme appearance and quickly see the results in the running lab.

## Theme Inheritance

To create a new theme that inherits styles from another theme, follow these steps:

1.  Log in as an administrator.
1.  Access the theme creation feature.
1.  Specify the new theme's settings, including the desired inheritance.
1.  Set the specific styling you want to override from the inherited theme.
1.  For example, if you want to style H1 headers in pink, ensure that you define this styling in the new theme, overriding any inherited values.

By leveraging theme inheritance, you can avoid excessive copy-pasting and easily modify specific styles while building upon existing themes.

## Conclusion

The Easier Legacy Lab Client Theming feature empowers enterprise customers to customize their lab client's appearance effortlessly. You can now make real-time changes to themes and experience immediate updates in running labs. Additionally, the ability to inherit styles and scripts from other themes simplifies the process of creating customized themes without repetitive copying.
