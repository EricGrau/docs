# How Do I Extend The Amount Of Time On The Lab Timer?

Each running lab has a timer in the upper right corner showing you the amount of time left before the lab will be cancelled or saved. A lab is cancelled if no activity was performed in lab; it is saved and closed if saving is allowed for the lab. Most, but not all, labs can have their times extended. 

When there is less than 10 minutes remaining you may extend the time you through a pop-up window by clicking **Yes**. This extends the lab by 15 minutes up to the maximum time allotted for the lab to be completed. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] Remember, not all labs can be extended or saved.
