|maxActiveLabInstances|Integer|No|The maximum number of active lab instances than can exist concurrently within this class context. This is optional in most situations. However, it is required for classes that host shared environments. If a shared lab is launched against a class that doesn't have this value set, the launch will fail.|
|availableLabs|Integer Array|No|An optional array of lab profile IDs. When provided, Lab on Demand will know that these labs are available within the class.
