# Manage Instructions Sets Dialog - Show Organization When Multiple Organizations are Represented

## Overview

This documentation explains the enhancement made to the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog. As a lab author, you will now see the organization name column when managing instruction sets, specifically when the organization on an instruction set differs from the organization on the lab profile. By displaying the organization name column, you can easily identify the organization associated with each instruction set. This enhancement improves the clarity and organization of instruction set management. Read on to learn more about this feature and how it affects the display of organizations.

## Introduction

To enhance the management of instruction sets, we have made improvements to the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog. This update ensures that you can easily identify the organization associated with each instruction set. The display of organizations is based on the comparison between the organization on an instruction set and the organization on the lab profile.

## Managing Instruction Sets Dialog

The "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog allows you to view and organize your instruction sets for effective lab management. This dialog provides an overview of the instruction sets associated with a lab profile, enabling you to perform actions such as editing, reordering, or deleting instruction sets.

## Displaying Organizations

With this enhancement, the organization name column will be displayed in the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog if the organization on an instruction set differs from the organization on the lab profile. This ensures that you can easily identify the organization associated with each instruction set, improving clarity and organization.

## Default Output Columns

The default output columns in the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog have been updated based on the organization comparison. The changes are as follows:

If the organization on an instruction set is different from the organization on the lab profile, the organization name column will be displayed by default.
If the organization on an instruction set is the same as the organization on the lab profile, the organization column will be hidden by default.
These default output column settings are designed to optimize the display and provide you with the relevant information needed for effective instruction set management.

## Considerations

When using the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog, please consider the following:

Ensure that the organizations on instruction sets and lab profiles are correctly set to reflect the intended associations.
If you encounter any issues or inconsistencies regarding the display of organizations, please reach out to your lab administrator or support team for assistance.
By incorporating the display of organizations in the "Manage Instruction Sets" dialog, this enhancement facilitates easier identification and organization of instruction sets associated with different organizations.

If you have any further questions or need additional support, please reach out to your lab administrator or support team.
