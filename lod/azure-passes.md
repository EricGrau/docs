# Azure Passes      

When launching a lab that uses Microsoft Azure, an Azure pass may be assigned to the lab if it is required to complete the lab instructions. These passes are provided in the lab, in the Resources tab. Some labs, such as cloud slice labs, may not require an Azure Pass, and an Azure Pass will not be assigned and available in the Resources tab of the lab. 

If the provided Azure Pass expires or is used during the course of training, and you wish to continue training in Azure, you can [sign up for a free Azure Pass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/).
