# Cloud Slice Quick Start - Configure Subscription

Estimated time to completion: **20 minutes**.

This is the first in a series of Quick Starts about Cloud Slice functionality in the Skillable Studio platform.

In this Quick Start, you will give Skillable Studio permissions to a cloud subscription that you want to use for Cloud Slice labs.

> [!ALERT] As a best practice, any subscription that you configure for use with Cloud Slice labs should be dedicated for that purpose. This practice keeps cloud resources used for learning separate from cloud resources that you may use for other test or production purposes. It also isolates expenses associated with Cloud Slice labs from expenses you may incur related to other cloud resources.

Granting Skillable Studio access to a cloud subscription can be a tedious process. Fortunately, you only have to go through it once for each subscription that you want to use, so let's roll up our sleeves and get started.

Select the cloud platform associated with the subscription you want to use with Cloud Slice and follow the steps to configure that subscription.

1. [Microsoft Azure](configure-subscription-azure.md).
1. Amazon Web Services (coming soon).
1. Google Cloud Platform (coming soon).

Now that you have configured your cloud subscription properly, click on the link below to go through the next Quick Start where you will add that cloud subscription into Skillable Studio.
