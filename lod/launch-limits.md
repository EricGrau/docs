# Lab launch limits

A course may have a variety of lab launch settings, from unlimited lab launches, to lab launch limits placed on individual labs, or a single limit for all the labs within the course. 

A lab is counted as launched after 60 seconds has elapsed, from the moment the Launch button was clicked. 
- Cancelling the lab before a minute is reached prevents the launch from counting towards the course launch limit.  
- Relaunching a saved lab does not count against remaining launches.


## Launch Limit Methods

- Unlimited lab launches are the default setting, and new lab instances can be launched at any time during the scheduled class session times, as well as during post class lab access. 
- Launch limits can be set on individual activities within a course, to specify the number of times each activity can be launched. 
    - For example, course Activity 1 could have a limit of 3 launches, Activity 2 has a limit of 5 launches and Activity 3 has unlimited launches. 
- A single limit for all labs in a course sets a limit on the number of times all the labs combined within the course can be launched. If a course lab launch limit is set to six then you can only launch any combination of the labs in the course 6 times. 
    - For example if a course is limited to 6 launches, and there are 3 lab activities in the course, you can launch a single lab six times to meet the limit or distribute the launches between any of the 3 labs to combine to six launches. 

## Launch Status Display

A message below the Launch button on the course will display the status of the lab launch.

- A lab with no limits on launches will display _Unlimited launch attempts_.
- A launch limit on a lab activity will display _X of X launch attempts remaining_.
- A lab that has met the launch limit will display _Attempt Limit Reached_.

When the maximum lab launches limit has been met for either a lab activity or all lab activities in the course, the Launch button will no longer be available and a message will be displayed that says _Attempt Limit Reached_ on all affected lab activities. When the limit is met, if the Launch button remains available, and is clicked, a message will be displayed that says _You have reached the maximum allowed attempts for this activity_. 

Launches that are unused during the class may be used during post class lab access, if post class lab access is enabled for the class.

If you would like to request an extension to your lab launches please reach out to your Training Organization.
