# How do I reuse search settings or create default settings on search pages?

Are you tired of having to add the same search filters and criteria every time you are on a search page? If so, you can save your search parameters for reuse any time. You can save one or more searches and you can select a search to be the default search which automatically opens each time you return to that page. Using saved searches is a convenient way to build reports you run periodically.

Searches can be saved on any Find page, like the Find Users, Find Enrollments or Find Courses pages. They can also be saved in any chooser, for instance, when you are creating a class the Choose Course dialog allows you to save searches. The saved searches for each find page and chooser are separate, a search saved on one find page is not available on other find pages or choosers.
