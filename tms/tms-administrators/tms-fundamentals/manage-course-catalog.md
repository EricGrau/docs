# How do I manage the course catalog?

Our Course catalog allows your users to browse your organization’s available courses. It is your decision whether you have a catalog or not. You must request a course catalog from [customer support](https://skillable.com/customer-support/), a guide is available [here](#catalog-request-guide) to request the features you want. Our course catalog has been adapted several times and can be displayed in one of two ways:  Simple Course Catalog Version 1, and Simple Course Catalog Version 2. Adding a course catalog also adds a **Courses** link on the Navigation bar to open it, however, the name of the link can be changed based on your organization’s preference.
Users can still view your available courses in the standard search format by accessing the organization profile; to do this, from any page click on the **organization name** link, then select the **Find Courses** link from the organization’s quick links bar.

## Catalog Features
The article below describes standard and custom features that are available for you in your course catalog. Many features need to be customized through our [customer support page](https://skillable.com/customer-support/), others are available for you to set up yourself.
Some components are available in all catalog versions, like access to the course details page, beginning or resuming self-paced training on a course available to you through a subscription or from a course assignment, adding a custom catalog name, focusing attention on courses through icons, such as, **New**, **Coming Soon** or **Featured**. Saving searches, exporting searches, and filtering are available in all versions of the catalog, however, filtering does evolve through the versions. Catalogs display as tiles showing a course graphic if one is available, icons to depict activities in the courses, and the ability to mark favorites. Filter headings and filters are custom created to allow searches.

Version 2 of the course catalog tiles show the logo of the platform used in the labs, such as, Azure or AWS. This is automatically pulled from the lab activities which are built into the labs.

### Add a custom image to your course
You can style your courses with custom images. Images show on the course catalog, subscription catalog, class browser and simple course assignments. You may want to have specific images based on platform or content to tie courses together. A custom image must be added to each course for any image to show for version 1 of the course catalog; if there is not an image the catalog tile for the course will be blank. However, in version 2 of the catalog, any course lacking a custom image is given a random triangulated image.

### Create custom filter headings and filters
Course tag groups and course tags are used to create filters in catalogs. Course tag groups create the filter headings which are added to the organization profile to automatically add the tag group and tags to all courses created by your organization and set the filters for the Course catalog. If you are using filters in an On-Demand Subscription catalog, Course tag groups are added to the subscription profile. [Click here](/tms/tms-administrators/self-paced-learning-and-subscriptions/subscription-filters.md) for instructions on creating filters and filter headers.

Filters in version 2 of our course catalog show on the filter menu.
