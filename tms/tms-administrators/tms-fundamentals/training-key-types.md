# What are the different types of training keys?

Training Keys are a great feature to help manage creating user accounts and training for students. You can use training keys to quickly and easily enroll students into both instructor-led or self-paced training without the need to manually create each training assignment. A training key is a code you distribute to users, that code is then redeemed creating their training and it can also be used for them to create their user account. Training keys can be aligned with classes, course assignments, and subscriptions.

## Types

We have several different types of training keys that can be used for different purposes, each with their own advantages:

- [Enrollment Training Keys](/tms/tms-administrators/classes/training-keys/class-training-keys.md) - Unique keys with one distributed to each student, used to create enrollments in an instructor-led class.
- [Event Training Keys](/tms/tms-administrators/classes/training-keys/class-training-keys.md) - One key shared to all students to create enrollments in an instructor-led class.
- [Training Key Pools](/tms/tms-administrators/self-paced-learning-and-subscriptions/training-key-pool.md) - A batch of keys aligned with a course used to create course assignments for the course.
- [Subscription Keys](/tms/tms-administrators/self-paced-learning-and-subscriptions/subscription-training-keys.md) - A batch of keys aligned with a subscription profile used to create a subscription assignment giving access the user to create course assignment from any of the courses in the subscription profile.

Some setup by our help desk is needed to enable the ability for students to create user accounts from your login page. Please submit a Support ticket at [**https://skill.info/support**](https://skill.info/support) for information.
