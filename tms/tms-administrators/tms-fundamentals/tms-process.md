# Getting Started - Using the Skillable Training Management System (TMS) to train your learners

Skillable TMS is our integrated LMS platform to deliver labs to your learners. You can manage learners and instructors, schedule classes and assign self-paced training. You can check lab instances to see your learners’ progress, instructors can virtually view and interact with learners by monitoring their labs as they work on them. Have learners and instructors launch all the course content, labs, courseware and your virtual meeting from a single web page. You can add multiple choice assessments, surveys for students, instructors or organizations and you have numerous options for automatically triggered notifications. Validate and recognize your learners’ achievements with certificates and badges.

## Publish to our TMS
 
For those who are creating their own labs, after your lab is published to the Skillable TMS, you must add it into a course to be delivered to your learners. Those who are purchasing content from a provider will be given access to your contracted courses.

A course is then added to a class for instructor led delivery or to a course assignment, training key pool, or subscription for self-paced delivery. Once a class is set up, students are enrolled manually, through the API, or through training keys. When self-paced training is set up, a course assignment or subscription can be manually assigned or given access through a training key.

### Create a Course
A course can hold all the content to deliver to your learner; it is a container with many settings which holds labs and other activities. After creating a course, you must add a publishing group to make it available to add to a class, course assignment or subscription. Once the course and publishing group are set up, you can choose delivery methods.

### Determine Delivery Mechanism
Labs are contained within a course then courses are added to delivery methods to place the labs into your learner’s hands. Delivery can be instructor led training through a class or self-paced training through a course assignment. 

A class is a set date and time when the instructor and students meet. When scheduling a class, a course is added to give access to the content and labs. Instructors have access to the course and labs when they are assigned to teach a class. Learners can access labs once class starts.

Self-paced learners can be assigned a single course through a course assignment or a set of courses through a subscription; a subscription gives a learner access to multiple courses which can be taken and retaken for a limited amount of time. Each course launched within a subscription is opened as a course assignment.

### Deliver your Training
You can choose to assign training manually, use the Skillable Connect TMS API, or use training keys for learners to self-register and access their training.

Instructor led learners can be enrolled manually one at a time or in groups. You can also use training keys to allow students to self-register and access their class. Learners have access to class labs from the start of the class through any post class lab access set for the course, normally 180 days. Students and instructors can connect directly to your virtual meeting host through the class. Instructors can monitor all student labs virtually during classes. 

Self-paced learner’s access to a course assignment is normally 180 days from the time it is created but may be set to less. You can manually create a single course assignment, multiple course assignments or use a training key pool to allow students to self-register and open a course assignment. Subscriptions can also be assigned manually to a single learner, multiple learners or through training keys which allows students to self-register and open their subscription.
