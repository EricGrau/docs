# How do I have users land on a custom page when logging in?

All organizations can choose where students, instructors and administrators land when they sign in. Organizations set up before the student, instructor, and administrator dashboards are set to default to My Training for students and Site Administration for instructors and administrators. After the dashboards became active, all new organizations are assigned to them by default.

For students, you can choose one of the following for the Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the My Training page
- **My Dashboard** - the student Dashboard
- **My Training** – currently is the same as Default
- **Subscription** – the On-Demand browser
- **Class Browser** – the Class Browser page
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the Skillable TMS or a Skillable TMS webpage

For instructors, you can choose one of the following for their Instructor Default Landing Page:
- **Not Set** - the Site Administration page
- **Instructor Dashboard** - the Instructor Dashboard
- **Custom** - requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the Skillable TMS or a Skillable TMS webpage

For users with administrative functions, you can choose the following for the Admin Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the Site Administration page
- **Site Admin** - the Site Administration page
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the Skillable TMS or a Skillable TMS webpage

For help setting your landing pages, please submit a support ticket from our [Customer Support](https://www.skillable.com/customer-support/) page.
