# How do I have users land on a custom page when logging in?

Organizations with a site in the TMS (a custom URL) can choose where students and administrators land when they sign in. There can be a landing page for your students and a different one for your administrators.

For students, you can choose one of the following for the Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the default landing page, currently the My Training page
- **My Training** – currently is the same as Default
- **Subscription** – the On-Demand browser
- **Class Browser** – the Class Browser page
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the TMS or a TMS webpage*.

For users with administrative functions, you can choose the following for the Admin Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the default landing page set, currently the Site Administration page
- **Site Admin** - currently is the same as Default
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the TMS or a TMS webpage*.

For help setting your landing pages, please submit a support ticket from our [Customer Support](https://www.skillable.com/customer-support/) page.
