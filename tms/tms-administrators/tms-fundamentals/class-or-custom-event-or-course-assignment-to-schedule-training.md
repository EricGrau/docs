# Should I use a class, a subscription or a course assignment to schedule training?

Two different types of training modes are designed to be used in the TMS: Instructor led training or Self paced training. Classes are used to schedule instructor led meeting sessions. Subscriptions and course assignments are used to schedule self-paced training.

A class allows you to select the days and times of your class sessions, add an instructor, enroll multiple students and assign physical or virtual classrooms. <a href="#note1">**<sup>1</sup>**</a>

**Class** - used to schedule an instructor-led meeting for multiple students with access to course activities and resources. 
-	Labs and other course activities (videos, links, assessments, etc.) can be accessed by students at the time the class is scheduled to begin
-	Post class access for most course content is 180 days
-	Students' labs can be monitored by instructors through the class
-	Resources added to a course are available to students once their Enrollment Status is marked Enrolled; access to resources is not tied to class sessions can be accessed at any time

**Course Assignment** - set up for one student to give access to a course's activities and resources. 
-	Course is taken as self-paced training
-   Labs and other course activities (videos, links, assessments, etc.) can be accessed when created 
-   Access usually expires in 180 days from creation of the assignment 
-	Is not designed to be supervised by an instructor
-	Does not have a classroom (physical or virtual)

**Subscription** - set up as a template to assign a set of courses to students for a specified length of time
-   A Subscription profile is set up as a template containing the courses, length of subscription, and other details
-   A subscription based on the profile is assigned to a student
-   Any courses in the subscription can be taken any number of times while the subscription is active
-   Courses are taken as self-paced training
-   Student accesses courses within a catalog
-   Labs and other course activities (videos, links, assessments, etc.) can be accessed when self assigned from the catalog as a course assignment
-   Access usually expires in 180 days from creation of the subscription

> <a id="note1">**<sup>1</sup>**</a> Adobe Connect virtual classroom access requires a signed contract with Adobe Connect before access is granted. If you have a different virtual classroom provider, please review [How can I use my organizationâ€™s virtual meeting platform in my virtual classes?](/tms/tms-administrators/classes/virtual-meetings/integratevirtualmeetingprovider.md).

> <a id="note2">**<sup>2</sup>**</a> The standard Instructor role does not permit a user to monitor course assignments. Course Assignments can be monitored by Operations Managers or by an instructor if organization management is assigned with the Instructor role. This gives the instructor administrative access to all the organization's data.

> <a id="note3">**<sup>3</sup>**</a> You can set up automated notifications, they can be enabled for Classes, Course Assignments or Subscriptions.
