# Can I rearrange items on the Site Administration page?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

The Site Administration page can be customized. Related topics are grouped together on tiles to help you navigate quickly. You can rearrange the tiles so the items you work with the most are at the top. To do this:
1. **Click and hold** on a tile you want to move
1. **Drag** it to the spot you want it
1. **Release** the tile

The other tiles will move to make room. Now every time you access the Admin page, you new organization is there until you decide to change it again.
