#   How do I create filters for a catalog?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

You can add custom filters to your organization’s Course catalog and On-Demand Subscription catalog to assist your users in locating courses that interest them. Both catalogs use the same style of filters and the setup is very similar.

*Filters used in a Course catalog*

A Course catalog is an optional feature you may have on your TMS site. This catalog displays any courses available to your organization set to show on the course catalog. The catalog is accessed from a navigation link available from the login page, or once users have logged in. If you are interested in adding a Course catalog to your site, please contact our [help desk](https://docs.skillable.com/tms/home.md?appid=tms). 

A Subscription On-Demand catalog is a feature available when using subscriptions and is enabled on the Subscription profile. This catalog displays any courses available within subscription(s) to the assigned user. [Click here](/tms/tms-administrators/self-paced-learning-and-subscriptions/subscription-description.md) for more information on subscriptions.

Once you have a Course catalog and/or a Subscription profile set up, you can create course tag groups and course tags to use as headings and item filters. 

## Course tag groups and Course tags

Course tag groups and course tags are used to create filters in catalogs. Course tag groups create the filter headings which are added to the organization profile to automatically add the tag group and tags to all courses created by your organization and set the filters for the Course catalog. If you are using filters in an On-Demand Subscription catalog, Course tag groups are added to the subscription profile.  

Course tags must be selected on courses to associate the filter to the course and are the filters under the heading. Tags must belong to a tag group to display in a catalog, and tags and tag groups can be created in any order and then associated with each other.

Course tags can be dependent on other course tags to create child filters in your catalog. When a tag is dependent on another tag, it only displays when the parent tag is selected. You can add multiple dependent tags to a parent, as well as any number of parent-dependent relationships.

You can find courses assigned a course tag from Find Courses by adding the filter for Course Tags. The Additional Tags can be used to add course tags to filter by in Find Courses, however, tags added there will not show on a catalog.

Take look at your Course catalog or assign yourself a subscription assignment to view the On-Demand Subscription catalog to review your filters.
