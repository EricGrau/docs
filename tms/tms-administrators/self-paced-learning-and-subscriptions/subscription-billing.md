# How are subscriptions billed?

Subscriptions are billed for each course assignment created through the subscription. Each time a subscriber starts a course, a course assignment is created, this is the billable event, it does not matter if they launch any activities. Each course assignment is invoiced for the month when it is created.

When setting pricing, be aware of the length the course assignment for the courses you add to a subscription and the duration you set on your subscription profile. The duration is the length of the user's subscription assignment; how long they have access to take the courses in the subscription. For example, if the courses entered in the subscription create course assignments that are available 180 days and your subscription duration is 180 days, then you will only be billed one time for each course that was started. However, if your subscription length is one year with courses are available for 180 days through course assignments, then you could be billed twice for the same course. If your user starts a course in the first month of the subscription, you are billed for it and it expires after 6 months; then in month 8 of the subscription if they take that course again you would be billed a second time for the same course.
