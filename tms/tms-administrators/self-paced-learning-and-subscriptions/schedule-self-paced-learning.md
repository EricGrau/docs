:small_blue_diamond: Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

Self-paced learning is provisioned through course assignments. giving a student direct access to labs and course activities without attending a class. A course assignment gives access to a single course and when created the student's access begins immediately normally defaulting to expire in 180 days. The expiration defaults based on the maximum days of access for a course assignment set on the organization profile. Course assignments are billed based on their creation date, but can be cancelled within 24 hours of creation if no labs have been launched. After the 24 hour window a request must be made to [**https://skill.info/support**](https://skill.info/support) for cancellation.

Students can access the course assignment from their **Current Training** page; under **Course Assignments**, the student clicks the name of the course to open it and access their activities. After a course assignment is completed, the assignment moves to the student's **Transcript** page.
