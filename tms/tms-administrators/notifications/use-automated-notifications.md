# How can I use automated notifications?
Automated notifications are a way to notify students, instructors and staff when something happens in the Skillable TMS. Most notifications are triggered based on an action taken in the platform, but we also have time triggers for enrollments and classes. Using notifications can save you a significant amount of time because you will not need to email people yourself.

Notifications are sent as emails to users based on the primary email address listed in their user profile. Users can opt out of notifications. Sending a notification does not guarantee it will be received. You can verify a notification was sent by the system, but it may be blocked by the userâ€™s email system. Notifications are also available within the platform from the envelope icon beside the user menu. The icon only displays when notifications have been sent to the user.

Some handy ways to use automated notifications are to notify:
* Instructors they are assigned to or removed from a class
* Instructors and students if a class is cancelled
* Students with a reminder before class begins
* Students with a thank you for having attended a class
* Students with a link to a survey to finish after class
* Students that they have been enrolled in a class
* Users of their username and password when their user account is first created
* Students that a course assignment is going to expire

You can set up as many notifications as you want. Be certain to test them before activating them.
