## Test an enrollment request notification

Testing a notification gives you the opportunity to verify that the notification sends when you want it to go out and does not send when you do not want it to go out. You can limit the impact by restricting the notification to only go out for one course.

Open your Notification Plan, if you have disabled the notification you will need to add the **Enabled** filter on the **Find Notifications page and filter by **Is not Enabled**.

To set up testing, begin by preparing your notification.
1. Click **Edit** on the notification.
1. Open the **Courses** tab and select **Specify courses**.
1. Under the **Individual courses** heading, click **Add course**.
1. Search for and select a course named, **Testing Automated Notifications**, then click **OK**. If you do not have access to this course open a ticket to our Help Desk.
1. On the **Basic Information** tab, check the **Enabled** box. 
1. **Save**.

Next create a class.
1. Create a new class using the course set on your notification. 
1. Verify any notification filters you have set are set in the class. For example, if the Class Status must be Scheduled for the notification to send, then set your Class Status to Scheduled.
1. **Save** the class.

Register for class as a student.
1. From **Find Users**, search for and select a fake user account, click on the **user's name** then click **OK**..
1. Click the **Impersonate** link to take action as that student.
1. Open the **Class Schedule**.
1. Find the test class and open it to view the class.
1. Click the **Request Enrollment** button.

Check for notifications.
1. Click the **Details** link in the top right corner of the page to return to the **Class** profile.
1. Click the **Find Sent Notifications** link to view all notifications sent for the class.

## Enable your notification

Once you have completed testing, you will want to enable your notification to put it in use.
1. Return to your **Notification Plan** to click **Edit** and open the **Courses** tab. 
1. To make your notification available for all courses used in your organization, remove the **Testing Automated Notifications** course and select **Applies to all courses**.
1. To make your notification available for specific courses used in your organization, remove the **Testing Automated Notifications** course. Click **Add Course** and select all courses that need this notification, then click **OK**.
