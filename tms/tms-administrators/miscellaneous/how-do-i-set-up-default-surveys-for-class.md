# How do I set up default surveys for classes? 

Surveys and survey availability can be set to be added by default on all new courses and all new classes. If different survey selections are added directly on a course, then a class based on the course inherits the course's surveys. Surveys can be added or changed on a class.

Surveys can be added for different user roles, and presented to users according to their role. 

- **Student**: survey presented to the student, to provide feedback about the class.
- **Instructor**: survey presented to the instructor, to provide feedback about the class. 
- **Organization**: survey presented to organization managers, to provide feedback about the class.
