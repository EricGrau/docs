# How do I Add Resources to a Course?

After a course has been created and saved, you can upload resources to the course. Resources added to a course are automatically added to any class or course assignment that is created from the course. 

Uploaded resources can be made available to students, instructors or both. If a student or instructor has access to view the resources, they will be able to download the resources as well.
