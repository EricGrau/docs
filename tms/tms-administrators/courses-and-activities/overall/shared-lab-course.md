# How do I create a course with shared labs?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

A shared lab provides interaction and collaboration amongst participant labs connected to a shared environment lab. All students can access the one shared lab environment simultaneously but with specific tools and services aligned with their participant lab. Shared labs may be used to create different learning experiences:
* **Cyber Range** – Groups of students can attack a common target, which is defended by another group of students, all in a safe and isolated network.
*	**Collaborative Learning** – Students collaborate to explore and learn, complete a challenge, solve a problem, or implement a technology.
*	**Role Playing** – Each student has a unique role and tools to work with others implementing a solution. 

Courses containing shared labs require specific configurations. The course should only contain those lab activities required for a shared lab. Participant lab(s) allow assignment to one or multiple students providing simultaneous access to a shared lab environment and the shared lab environment will only be accessible by the instructor. 

Any other course profile configuration will impact pricing.

Pricing is also impacted by all available participant labs whose development status is **Complete**, the lab is enabled and published for consumption. Though a participant lab may not be a lab activity in a course, if its shared environment lab is a lab activity in a course and it is the most resource-intensive participant lab published, then its price will be used to configure pricing for the course. Therefore, do not publish any participant lab that should not be consumed. 

Requests for altered course configurations require pre-approval by both the Learn on Demand Systems Chief Product Officer and your Account Executive before being created and made available to your organization for scheduling and consumption.

> :small_blue_diamond: Due to the requirements for course configurations, only Learn on Demand Systems staff can create courses that incorporate shared labs. 

Notify our help desk at https://lod.one/help to set up the course. Specify the following information:

- Name of course
- Name of Lab Series in LOD
- Name of Participant labs to add as Lab Activities to the course.

The following configurations will be implemented for all courses using a shared lab:

* Delivery is set to Available Instructor-led.
* The shared environment lab is only accessible and launchable by the Instructor.
* Participant lab(s) are consumed by students.
