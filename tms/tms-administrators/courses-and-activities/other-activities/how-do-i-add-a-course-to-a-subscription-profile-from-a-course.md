Subscriptions deliver on-demand, self-paced training to your users through a set of courses. These courses are available to the user to take and retake an unlimited number of times within a limited time period. For more information, read our [Subscriptions Documentation](tms/tms-administrators/self-paced-learning-and-subscriptions/subscription-description.md).

## Add a Course to a Subscription from a Course Profile

1. On the **Create Course** or **Edit Course** page, click **Subscription Profiles**.
1. Select **Add Subscription Profile**. 
1. **Search** for the Subscription Profile you wish to add the course to. 
1. Select **OK**. 
1. **Save** the Course. 

The course is now added to the Subscription Profile and any course assignments that use that Subscription Profile will now include this course.
