# How can I find how long a lab will be saved?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

The length of time a lab is saved is determined by several factors, among them: a user's roles, the type of learning (Instructor-led vs. Self-paced) and class sessions scheduled.

Standard lab saves are as follows:

- Users with the **Operations Manager** role can save 2 labs for 7 days.
- Users with an **Instructor** role can save 5 labs for 7 days.
- Students can save up to 2 labs:
     - Self-paced learning through a course assignment provides 7-day lab saves 
     - Instructor-led training scheduled on consecutive class days has 7-day lab saves
     - Instructor-led training scheduled on non-consecutive class days has 7-day lab saves 

We can set up lab saves outside of these defaults for special circumstances when necessary. If you need labs in a class to be saved for a different time period, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help).
