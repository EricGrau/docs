# How do I set lab launch limitations?

Lab launches are automatically set to be unlimited, however, you can set limitations on the number of times a learner may launch labs. Limits may be placed either on an individual lab or on a course. 

A launch limit is placed on an individual lab only applies to that lab. You may set launch limits on any lab within a course, once that launch limit is met the learner cannot launch that lab again. Labs either show a count of the remaining number of launches or show that lab launches are unlimited. 

A launch limit placed on a course applies to all labs within the course; any lab launched counts against the lab launch limit. Once the launch limit is met the learner cannot launch any lab in the course. 

A lab is counted as launched after 60 seconds pass from when the Launch button was clicked. Cancelling a lab before a minute is reached does not reduce your lab launch count nor does relaunching a saved lab does not count against remaining launches, only the launch of a new lab instance.

When a class or course assignment is created from a course that has this feature enabled, each student’s lab launches are limited to the value set on the ‘Maximum Lab Launches per delivery method’. If the lab activity is cancelled in less than 1 minute or the lab is saved, the lab launch count remains unchanged.

Once a student meets the ‘Maximum Lab Launches per delivery’ threshold, the ‘Launch’ button is hidden and an ‘Attempt Limit Reached’ message will appear within the lab activity tile. If the user interface is not updated immediately to reflect the threshold being met, then the following message will appear within the lab window when the ‘Launch’ button is clicked.

Once the class is completed and each student has met the maximum lab launches threshold, no post class lab access is available, unless the value in the ‘Maximum Lab Launches per delivery’ is removed at the course level.

Course creation
If the ‘Limit maximum lab launches per delivery method (enrollment / course assignment)’ is checked a ‘Maximum Lab Launches per delivery method’ shows. A value greater than 1 must be entered. If blank, the following message will appear when the Save button is clicked. 
 
If the ‘Yes’ button is clicked, the feature is unchecked, and the change is saved. Any class enrollments or course assignments will not have any lab launches available. If the ‘No’ button is clicked, the user remains on the Course Activities tab.
Course Limit Attempts for Lab Activities
A TMS Organization can now set limits to the number of lab retakes available from a course activity. If ‘Allow Retakes’ is checked on a course’s lab activity, a ‘Limit Attempts’ checkbox will show and is unchecked by default. If ‘Limit Attempts’ is checked a ‘Maximum Attempts’ field will show. A value greater than 2 must be entered. If blank, students will have an unlimited amount of lab launches for enrollments and course assignments. This feature works the same as the course’s ‘Limit Maximum Lab Launches Per Delivery Method’ but is set at the individual lab activity level.
