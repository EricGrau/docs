## Add a lab activity

The steps below assume you have completed the Basic Information section in the course ([How do I create a basic course?](./overall/create-course.md)). Before adding a course activity, you should select whether the course will available instructor-led and/or available self-paced on the Basic Information tab. This will affect the defaults for visibility of the activities you add for classes and course assignments.

To add a lab to your course:
1. On the **Create Course** or **Edit Course** page, click **Activities**.
1. Click **Add Lab**.
1. In the **Choose Lab** dialog, search for and select the lab(s) you want to add to the course and click **OK**. See [What does it mean when I get a 'Max RAM settings' warning when adding a lab to a course?](max-ram.md) for additional information.


Each lab activity has the following fields you can set for more control over that activity.
- **Availability** dropdown - limits who can view and launch the lab activity. It defaults to Everyone but you can limit it to Instructors only if the activity is not intended for student consumption. When **Everyone** is selected the **Assign to Students Manually** option displays.
- **Required for course completion** - requires a student to complete the lab for the course assignment or class enrollment to be marked **Complete**.
- **Available Instructor-Led** - makes the activity visible in classes and class enrollments
- **Available Self-Paced** - makes the activity visible in course assignments
- **Allow Retakes** - controls whether the student is able to launch the lab again after completing it
- **Allow Multiple Attempts** - allows unlimited lab launches by learner
  - **Limit Attempts** - set the number of times a learner can launch the lab
- **Assign to Students Manually** - gives class instructors the ability to assign the activity to individual students in a class
- **Instruction Sets** - shows when Instruction Sets are implemented within Studio allowing one lab profile to make use of multiple sets of instructions. Instructions can be written to different difficulty levels or for different content while utilizing the same lab profile. Each different type of instruction set can also have multiple languages, when an instruction set with a specific language is selected on a course's lab activity then all users launching the lab will receive the instructions in that language. Once Default is set up on a course's lab activity, our platform detects the end user's browser language to determine the appropriate instruction set and will use the instruction set matching that language. If no instruction set is chosen then the default from Studio will be used.
