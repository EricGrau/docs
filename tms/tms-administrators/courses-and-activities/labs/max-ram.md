# What does it mean when I get a 'Max RAM settings' warning when adding a lab to a course?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you. 

To ensure we maintain a high level of availability for labs, organizations have limits on the size of lab they can add to their courses. This limit may vary based on the type of lab. If the RAM of a lab you are adding to a course exceeds the limit for your organization for that type of lab, you will receive the following message upon the addition of the lab:

This message has a link to submit support ticket. Upon submittal of this ticket, the help desk team will assist with updating the course upon approval of your sales person and an understanding of your consumption projections. The default setting is 50GB RAM for each type of lab, Hyper-V and ESX.

You can view the size of labs when adding them to a course:
1. In the **Choose Lab** dialog, click **Output Options**.
1. Verify **Virtualization Platform** is checked. This displays the type of lab.
1. Check **RAM** and click **Search**.
