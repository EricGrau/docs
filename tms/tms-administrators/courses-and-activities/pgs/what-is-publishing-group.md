# What is a Publishing Group?

A Publishing Group is a set of courses that you grant access to other organizations for them to use for their classes and course assignments. You can have multiple publishing groups, each for a different purpose or audience without having to duplicate your courses for each group.

There are two types of access to publishing groups that can be granted:
1. **Availability** - this allows your sub-organizations to make their courses available through your publishing group for other organizations to use.
1. **Published Organizations** - this allows these organizations to consume the courses through their classes and course assignments. This is handled through an authorization form with LODS in the same manner as was done for content providers. Organizations with this access are called Published Organizations. 

Published organizations are only able to have access to a course through one publishing group at a time. Therefore, the Best Practice steps for creating a publishing group are as follows:

1. Create the publishing group (see [How do I create a Publishing Group?](create-publishing-group.md)).
    1. An internal Publishing Group will automatically be created for your organization if you are creating proprietary content.
1. Add the ability for sub-organizations to add their content.
1. Add courses (see [How do I add a course to my publishing group?](add-courses-to-publishing-group.md)).
1. Add organizations you manage as Published Organizations (see [How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?](add-published-orgs-to-publishing-group.md)). For those organizations you do not manage, an authorization form needs to be completed with LODS for the organization, and the LODS Operations team will add them as a Published Organization.
