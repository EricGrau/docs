# What is a Publishing Group?

A Publishing Group is a means to grant access to a set of courses to be used by your own organization or other organizations for  classes and course assignments. You may only have one publishing group, which can be used exclusively for all your courses within your own organization or you can have multiple publishing groups, each for a different purpose, audience or organization. A course must be added to a publishing group to be available to add to classes or self-paced training. A single publishing group named after your organization is created for you to use when your company is added into the TMS, you may create more if you need them.

There are two types of access to publishing groups that can be granted:
1. **Availability** - allows your sub-organizations to make their courses available through your publishing group for other organizations to use.
1. **Published Organizations** - allows these organizations to consume the courses through their classes and course assignments. This is handled through your sales person with an authorization form in the same manner as was done for content providers. Organizations with this access are called Published Organizations. 

Published organizations are only able to have access to a course through one publishing group at a time. Therefore, the Best Practice steps for creating a publishing group are as follows:

1. Create the publishing group (see [How do I create a Publishing Group?](create-publishing-group.md)).
    1. An internal Publishing Group will automatically be created for your organization if you are creating proprietary content.
1. Add the ability for sub-organizations to add their content.
1. Add courses (see [How do I add a course to my publishing group?](add-courses-to-publishing-group.md)).
1. Add organizations you manage as Published Organizations (see [How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?](add-published-orgs-to-publishing-group.md)). For those organizations you do not manage, an authorization form needs to be completed with your sales person for the organization, and our TMS Operations team will add them as a Published Organization.
