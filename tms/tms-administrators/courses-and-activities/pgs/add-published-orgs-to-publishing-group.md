# How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you. 

For other organizations to consume your courses through their classes and course assignments, they must belong to your publishing group. 

Now that you have created your publishing group and added it to your courses with a specific audience in mind, the final Best Practice step is to add the published organizations. For organizations you manage, you can add them yourself, but for all other organizations, there is an authorization process that is handled by TMS Operations.

## For Organizations You Manage
1. Navigate to the publishing group and click **Edit**.
1. On the **Published Organizations** tab, click **Add Organizations**.
1. In the **Choose Organizations**, search for and select the organizations you want to add and click **OK**.

> :small_blue_diamond: Organizations are only allowed to have access to a course through one publishing group. Therefore, you may receive an error message: **[Organization] already has access to [Course] from [Publishing Group]**. This will block the organization from being added. To add the organization, you will need to resolve the conflict first. You can do this by either removing the course from either publishing group or removing the published organization from the other publishing group.

## For Organizations You Don't Manage
This is handled through an authorization form with your sales person in the same manner as was done for content providers. If you would like to start offering your proprietary content to our other customers, please reach out to your Account Executive.

Once the authorization process has been completed, the TMS Operations team will add the requested organization to the Published Organizations list of the publishing group.

## Remove Published Organizations
To remove an organization's access to a publishing group, the organization can be removed from the Published Organizations list:

1. Navigate to the publishing group and click **Edit**.
1. On the **Published Organizations** tab, click the X next to the organization you manage that you would like to remove.
1. Click **Save** to save the change.

> :small_blue_diamond: Removing access to content from an organization will not automatically alert the organization, but it removes access to see the courses, which prevents them from scheduling any new events. Classes that have taken place in the past, are currently running, or already scheduled will not be affected. Students in these classes will still be able to launch the labs until their regular access has expired.
