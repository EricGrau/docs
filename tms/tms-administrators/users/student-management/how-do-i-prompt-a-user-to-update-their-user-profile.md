# How do I Prompt a User to Update Their User Profile?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

You can set a field on a user account profile to flagged, so that the user will be prompted to update that field the next time they log in.

## Flag a User Profile

To flag a field on a user profile: 

1. Navigate to the **user profile** you wish to flag. 

1. **Edit** the user profile. 

1. Click the **Flag icon** next to any field that you wish to flag the user to update. 

1. Click **Save** on the user profile. 

The user will be prompted to update the flagged fields the next time they log in. If the user does not update the field and closes the prompt, they will be prompted the next time they log in. They will continue to be prompted each time they log in, until they update the flagged field. 

## Flaggable Fields

All fields on the user profile are not flaggable. Fields that are flaggable have a flag icon next to them. 

Flaggable fields include: 

- First Name
- Last Name
- Job Title
- Primary Phone
- Secondary Phone
- Address
- Address 2
- City
- State
- Zip Code
- Country
- Time Zone
