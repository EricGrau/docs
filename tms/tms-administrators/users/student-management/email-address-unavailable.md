# What do I do if an email address is unavailable when I am creating a user account?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

When you are trying to create a user or instructor account and the email address you used shows as unavailable, this means the address has already been used.

The first thing to do is to find the existing user account. 
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Users** group, click **Find Users**. 
1. Add the **Disabled** filter and set it to **Is Or Is Not Disabled**.
1. Add the **Email** filter and input the email address. 
1. Click **Search**. 

If your user comes up, then the user account does not need to be created; you can re-enable it. 

## For instructor accounts

If you do not see the instructor account in the search results, you may need to widen your search to include the contract instructor pool.

If you still do not find the instructor account you may do one of the following:

1. Submit a Support ticket at [**https://skill.info/support**](https://skill.info/support) and 
        1. Ask us to add the instructor to the class for you.
1. Create a user account for the instructor with an alternate email address.
