While scheduling a class has many options available for you to revise, there are only four items you must set to create an instructor-led class using a custom virtual meeting. You must choose the course, set the meeting times, set the meeting place, and add your instructor.

The basic necessities to create a class:
1. Choose the course for the content and labs presented in the class
1. Set the date(s) and times for the class to meet
1. Add your virtual delivery URL
1. Create a user account for your instructor and add your instructor to the class

To create a class:
From the **Site Administration** pageâ€™s **Classes** tile, click **Create** Class. This opens the Create Class page.

In the **Basic Information** section, you will add a Course:
1. To add a Course, click the **Choose** button next to the **Course** field.
1. A **Choose Course** dialog opens, input part of the course **Name** and click **Search**.

        1. **Username**
        1. **Password/Confirm Password**
        1. **Save** the user account. The instructor role is automatically added when the user is created from the Instructor section.
