# How do I create classrooms?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

You can prevent double booking and overbooking of your physical classrooms when you add classes and assign students to your classes. When a classroom is assigned to a class, the Skillable TMS checks its availability and will warn you of conflicts. It also checks the capacity of the room when enrollments assigned to the classroom are added to the class.

To create a classroom:
1.  On the **Admin** menu in the **Classrooms** group, click **Create Classroom**. This opens up the Create Classroom page. 
1. On the **Basic Information** tab, type the **Name** of the classroom and set its **Capacity**. The Organization field is automatically filled in from your profile. 
1. Click **Save** to create the classroom.
