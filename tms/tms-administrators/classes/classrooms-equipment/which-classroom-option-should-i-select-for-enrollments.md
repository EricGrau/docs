# Which Classroom Option Should I Select for Classes and Class Enrollments

Each student enrollment has an option to specify a location or classroom to show where the student is attending; at your location, at an off-site room, or attending virtually. This allows you to track usage of your rooms, set up automated notifications specific to the attendee's experience, and prepare rooms and courseware for class attendance.

Automated notifications can be set up so that you can send different notifications based on whether a student is attending in a classroom at your location, at an off-site classroom, or if they are attending virtually. For more information, see our [Automated Notifications documentation](../../notifications/use-automated-notifications.md).

Classrooms have 3 options available: 

- **Classroom**: Students enrolled to attend in a physical classroom in your center. Select the classroom name.

- **Remote classroom**: A classroom or location organized by your organization where students can virtually attend a class. Set the enrollment classroom to Virtual/Remote and assign a physical classroom to their enrollment.

- **Virtual**: Students attending virtually are not using any of your organization's space, and may be attending from home or the office. Set the enrollment's classroom to Virtual/Remote and **do not assign a physical classroom**. 

## Class 

Your class set up determines which attendance locations are available to use. **On a class, the Delivery tab allows you to set a class as physical, physical and virtual or virtual**. 

- A class that is set to have physical delivery and that has classrooms assigned, enables the class enrollment to choose from those classrooms. 
- A class delivered virtually allows you to set up a class enrollment as Remote or Virtual.
