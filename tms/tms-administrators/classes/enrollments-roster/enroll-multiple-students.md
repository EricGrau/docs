# How do I enroll multiple students?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

There are a couple of tools in the TMS you can use to register students. The the class roster is the one that lets you create multiple registrations all at once while the Create Multiple Enrollments tool lets you add enrollments to one or more classes for one or more students. Several different registration statuses exist to help you track whether the student should be granted access to a class.

### Use Create Multiple Enrollments
Using Create Multiple Enrollments has the flexibility to let you enroll one student in multiple classes, multiple students into one class, or multiple students into multiple classes. When creating multiple enrollments, successful and failed enrollments are listed after the registrations are saved; the tool checks if the user is already registered for a class or if there will be a schedule conflict, either of these conflicts will cause a registration to fail.

> :small_blue_diamond: Adding students to class it is best to set the Enrollment Status to Requested. Then when the students show up for the class, mark them Enrolled. If they do not show up, mark them Cancelled. Note that LODS uses the Enrolled status to trigger billing for lab usage. Therefore, after a class begins the system will not permit the Enrollment Status of **Enrolled** to be changed. But you can change the **Requested** status to another status.

Students' enrollment statuses will need to be changed to Enrolled or Cancelled after the class starts.

> :small_blue_diamond: Students must be in the status of Enrolled to be able to launch their labs when class starts.
