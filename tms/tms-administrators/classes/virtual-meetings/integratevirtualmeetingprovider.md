You can easily use the virtual meeting provider of your choice to provide interactive virtual training solutions. Setting up a virtual meeting provider just takes a few clicks, you can create training using your preferred virtual meeting provider in your classes. If you are using Teams, GoToMeeting, Adobe Connect, Zoom or another service, it can be used to give students and instructors access within a class. This will give your instructors and students everything they need for their class from one page. 

We also have a full integration into the TMS available using Adobe Connect and Zoom. [Click here for more information.](/tms/tms-administrators/classes/virtual-meetings/integrated-virtual-meetings.md) The information below applies to any virtual meeting host.

## Enter your Meeting URL for your Class

If you do not set pre and post class launch windows, then your instructors and students will see the Enter Classroom button immediately; with times entered, the Enter Classroom button is available based on your settings.

When students come to their enrollment, they can enter the virtual meeting or open their labs. Clicking the Enter Classroom button directly adds them into the virtual meeting. If the meeting host has not started the meeting, they need to wait for the meeting to begin. The launch buttons for labs and course activities appear when class begins.

#### Creating User Accounts and Enrolling Students

We have several methods of creating user accounts and enrolling students. The simplest method is to provide each student a training key; the key allows them to create a user account and enroll into class.

User accounts can be created manually or imported. Once created the users can be enrolled as a group into your class.
