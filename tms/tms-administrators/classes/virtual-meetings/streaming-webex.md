# How can I use Webex in a Skillable TMS class?

> Please be aware that the functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

Give your students and instructors the convenience of one place for all members of the class to open their virtual classroom and all their course activities and labs. Deliver your Instructor-led training virtually with Webex within a Skillable TMS class.  

**Find your Webex URL**

When you have completed scheduling a meeting in Webex you can access the meeting’s URL to input in the TMS class. Look up the meeting by name on your Cisco Webex site. Under Meeting Information, you will find the Meeting Link. Copy the URL provided. If you have not set a password for the meeting, your users can attend once the meeting has started without registering or entering a password.

**Enter your webex URL in your Class**

If you have used the Skillable TMS before for classes, then the only new element is adding Webex for your class’ delivery. If you have not set up a class before, you can find links to additional resources below.

**Creating User Accounts and Enrolling Students**

We have several methods of creating user accounts and enrolling students. The simplest method is to provide each student a training key; the key allows them to create a user account and enroll into class.

User accounts can be created manually or imported. Once created the users can be enrolled as a group into your class.
