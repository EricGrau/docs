# How do I set up integrated virtual meeting hosts?

We have an integration in place for two virtual meeting platforms: Adobe Connect and Zoom. Integrating a virtual meeting host into the Skllable TMS makes scheduling easier. Scheduling a class in the TMS automatically creates a meeting in your virtual meeting host. It also gives each student links to class recordings directly in their enrollment. This gives your students and instructors one place to open their virtual meeting, launch all their class activities, and access any class recordings. 

Please note, we have no control over changes made in Adobe Connect or Zoom or outages on their platforms. We are only providing a service to allow meetings to be created and opened within the Skillable TMS platform.

## Adobe Connect Integrated Meeting Host Setup

Once you have an Adobe Connect contract you will need to send our help desk the following information.

## Zoom Integrated Meeting Host Setup

To integrate Zoom into the TMS, you will need a licensed Zoom account, set up an integration application in Zoom, and then send some information to our help desk for set up in the TMS. Once you have decided on a Zoom plan and have an account, you will need to set up the Server-to-Server OAuth app, this lets Zoom and the TMS communicate. Follow the instructions below to create the Server-to-Server OAuth app and send us the Account ID, Client ID, Client Secret, and the email of a licensed user.

Go to the [Zoom App Marketplace.](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) 

1.	From the **Develop** menu, select **Build App**
1.	This opens a **Choose your app type** page, on the **Server-to-Server OAuth** tile click **Create**.
1.	Fill out the information to create the app
1.	To set up Zoom, we will need your **Account ID**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. We also need the **email of a licensed Zoom user** to verify the set up.

The integration will be broken if you regenerate the API Secret after the integration is set up.
