## How do I find virtual meeting URLs for classes?

> Please be aware that the functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

Virtual classes may be set up using a custom virtual meeting host. Once a meeting is scheduled in your virtual meeting host, the meeting URL is added for the class delivery. Students are able to access the virtual meeting from their class enrollment. If you are using a virtual meeting provider for your classes, you may wish to view the meeting IDs or URLs set for each class. 

#### Find your class meeting IDs

To find your classes that use custom virtual classrooms, you can use the **Custom Virtual Classroom** filter and output option on **Find Classes**.
