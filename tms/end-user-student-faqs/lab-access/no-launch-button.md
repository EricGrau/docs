# Why isn't a launch button showing for my lab?

There can be several reason why a launch button has not showed up for your labs or other course activities. 

If you do not have a launch button on your labs in a class, please check the following:

* **Has your class date and time past?**
  Launch buttons do not appear until the scheduled class start time. 
  
* **Is there a End User License Agreement (EULA) in place for the class or course, and have you agreed to it?**
  License Agreements can control access to labs, all other course activities, and virtual classrooms. If a License Agreement is unchecked, it can prevent the launch buttons to appear. Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC) labs, have a Microsoft License Agreement which must be agreed to for lab launch buttons to show. See if you have agreed by looking in the basic information section of your class page. 

* **Has your lab access expired?**
  Many classes continue to allow access to labs after a class is over, this is referred to as post class lab access. Normally, the access is set to 180 days after the end date of the class, but it can vary between no access at all to any number of days after a class is finished. When you have post-class lab access, the date your access expires is listed on your Class Enrollment page.

_The Activities section on your enrollment displays when your access to launch the course's labs ends._

* **Is there a limitation on the number of times you can launch a lab?**
  Most labs have unlimited launches available, however, some have limits placed on the number of times a lab can be launched. Look here for more information on [lab launch limits](/tms/end-user-student-faqs/lab-access/difference-between-lab-expiration-and-lab-access.md)

_This lab shows that all lab launches have been used and there are no more lab launches available._

If none of the above applies please reach out to your training organization.
