# How do I access my labs using a lab code without a user account?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If this is the case, as a student who has been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in or create your user account. The login page for the site you are given will have a Sign In button and may have either a **Create a user account** link or a **Register with Training Key** field. There are also options to create an account through your Microsoft or Google logins.

Directions differ slightly depending on which items you see.  

## Site has a link to **Create a user account**
A Create an Account link may be found on the login page under the Sign In button.
1. Fill in all the fields to register and click **Save**. 
1. This will open a Current Training page. Click **Redeem Training Key**. 
1. Input the code you received and click **Redeem Training Key**.

Once you have an account and have redeemed your Training Key, you will no longer need the lab code/training key to login. You will logon with your username and password at the same URL as before. This opens the Current Training page; click on the course name to return to your labs.
