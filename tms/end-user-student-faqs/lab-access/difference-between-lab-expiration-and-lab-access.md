# What do I need to know about lab access, lab expiration, and lab launch limits?

Sometimes people are confused about their labs: how to know when their access to a lab expires, if they will lose their work in a lab, if labs are automatically cancelled, and if there are any limits on how many times a lab can be saved. 
Saving a lab is the only way to retain the work you have accomplished. Canceling, Xing out of the lab window or marking it Complete wipes any work done, and the next launch will be a fresh lab instance.

## Post class lab access
Many classes continue to allow access to labs after a class is over, this is referred to as Post class lab access. Normally, the access is set to 180 days after the end date of the class, but it can vary between no access at all to any number of days after a class is finished. When you have post-class lab access, the date your access expires is listed on your Class Enrollment page. 
Self-paced training access through a course assignment normally ends 180 days after its creation date. 

## Lab access 
Lab access is how long you have access to **launch** a new instance of a lab. Access to class labs begins at the start date and time of your class and may extend after a class is over based on the post class lab access that is set up. Access to labs for self-paced training through course assignments begins as soon as the assignment is created and ends 180 days after the creation date, regardless of if or when work on the assignment started.

Limits can be set on the number of times a lab can be launched, see Lab launch limits below.
The class instructors and operations managers have access to their class labs at any time, course labs are sometimes restricted from instructor access.

## Lab expiration
Lab expiration is when a lab you have saved expires. When you have launched a lab and then saved it, you are shown a date and time when it will be automatically cancelled from the system. If your lab is cancelled, you lose all the work you have done in the lab, but you may have the option to launch a fresh instance of the lab depending on your post class lab access and any lab launch limits.

You can prevent your lab from being cancelled by reopening it prior to the expiration date and saving it again extending the time by receiving a new expiration date and time. If you have unlimited lab launches, then regardless of the expiration date set on a saved lab, you are able to launch a fresh lab as long as you are still working within the time frame of your class or post class lab access.

## Lab launch limits
A course may have one of a variety of lab launch settings from unlimited lab launches, to lab launch limits placed on individual labs, or a single limit for all the labs within the course. Unlimited lab launches are the default setting, and new lab instances can be launched at any time during the class and during post class lab access. 

Unlimited lab launches allow a lab to be launched any number of times during the time period it is available to use; from the start time of a class to the end of class or post class lab access. 

An individual lab launch limit is set on a single lab activity allowing the lab to be launched a specific number of times, for example, Lab activity 1 may have a limit of three launches, Lab activity 2 has a limit of five launches, and Lab activity 3 has unlimited launches. 

A single limit for all labs all labs in a course sets a limit on the number of times all the labs combined within the course can be launched. If a course lab launch limit is set to six then you can only launch any combination of the labs in the course 6 times, for example, if there are three lab activities in the course you can launch a single lab six times to meet the limit or distribute the launches between any of the three labs to combine to six launches.
A lab is counted as launched after 60 seconds pass from when the Launch button was clicked; cancelling the lab before a minute is reached does not count against your lab launch count. Relaunching a saved lab does not count against remaining launches, only the launch of a new lab instance. 

A message below the Launch button presents the labâ€™s launch status. 
* A lab with no limits on launches reads **Unlimited launch attempts**
* A launch limit on a lab activity reads **X of X launch attempts remaining**

* A lab that has been launched and the limit met reads **Attempt Limit Reached**

When the maximum lab launches are met for either a lab activity or all lab activities in the course, the Launch button disappears and a message of **Attempt Limit Reached** displays in the affected lab activity. When the limit is reached, if the Launch button remains and is clicked a message of **You have reached the maximum allowed attempts for this activity** displays. Launches that are unused during the class may be used during any post class lab access set for the class.
