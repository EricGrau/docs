# How do I access my labs for a class using a lab code when I have a user account?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If you have been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in. If you do not have a code or have not been given credentials to log in, please contact your learning organization.

On the URL provided to you:
1. Click the Sign in button.
1. Choose your login method and follow the prompts if you are using an alternate platform for authentication.
1. If you are using a Skillable account for authentication, under the **Sign in with your user name** heading, enter your **user name** and **password**, and click **Sign in**.
3. This opens My Training page. Click **Redeem Training Key**.
4. Enter the training key or code that you received, and click **Redeem Training Key**.

    > Your training assignment will open.

1. Click **Launch** next to the lab you want to start.
