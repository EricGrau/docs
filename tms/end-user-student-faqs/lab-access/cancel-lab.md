# How do I launch, cancel, save and relaunch a lab?

It is important to know how to use the labs in the course you are taking; launching, saving, cancelling, and relaunching labs are common actions when working on labs. There are limitations on saved labs and there may be limits placed on the number of lab launches permitted. 

For instructor-led training, lab access begins when the class date and start time is reached. Access to labs can be limited to be available only during the days the class runs, but most classes have post class lab access which can range from 0 to 180 days after the class end date. The date and time when your lab access expires is listed at the top of your Activities section.



On some courses, instructors have the ability to assign labs to specific students, in this case only students assigned a lab will see it in their activities. Instructors may also have the ability to disable access to labs, if a lab is disabled by the instructor you will still see the lab activity .
