## Cancel a lab
When you cancel a lab, you lose all the work you have done in it. This has little consequence if you have unlimited lab launches, but if you have a limited number of lab launches a cancelled lab counts against your total lab launches.

#### To cancel a lab:
1. In the upper right corner of the Instructions pane, open the **hamburger menu** 
1. Select **End**
1. Click the radio button for **Cancel my lab**
1. Click **OK**
1. Close the lab window

## Save a lab
Saving a lab retains your work in the lab allowing you to come back to where you left off and continue working through it.

#### To save a lab:
1. In the upper right corner of the Instructions pane, open the **hamburger menu** 
1. Select **Save**
1. Note the date and time the lab will be cancelled
1. Click **Yes, save my lab**
1. Close the lab window
