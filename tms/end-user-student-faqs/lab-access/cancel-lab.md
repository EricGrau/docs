## Save a lab
Saving a lab retains your work in the lab allowing you to come back to where you left off and continue working through it. You are given an end date and time when the saved lab will be cancelled. Once your lab is saved you may open and save the lab again to obtain a new cancellation date and extend your time to work on it. Relaunching a saved lab does not count against your total lab launches.

#### To save a lab:
1. From the lab window's Instructions pane in the upper right corner, open the **hamburger menu** 
1. Select **Save**
1. Note the date and time the lab will be cancelled
1. Click **Yes, save my lab**
1. Close the lab window
