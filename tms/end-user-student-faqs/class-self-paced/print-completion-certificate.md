## Find your certificate?

Training certificates are located on your account page under "My Transcripts". Not all training organizations utilize our site for hosting completion certificates. If you are unable to locate your transcripts please ensure your training is marked as "Complete". If there is no Training Certificate under "My Transcripts", please reach out to your training organization for assistance. 


## Print your certificate
Completion certificates can be printed after the class is over and you have been marked complete on the class roster or you have completed a course assignment. 

To print the completion certification:
