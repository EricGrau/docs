# Why am I unable to redeem my Training Key?

There can be multiple reasons you are unable to redeem a Training Key. 

Check each of the steps below to verify there are no outside causes to your training key redemption:  
1. Review the spelling, be certain there are no extra characters or spaces 
2. Training keys are case sensitive, check that all characters are properly cased
3. Check that you are logged into the proper account
4. Verify you are using the links provided with your training key, especially if you are taking a training with a new organization 
5. Training keys are only redeemed once: they do not need to be used each time a student tries to access training 

Please reach out to your training organization should you receive any errors while attempting to redeem your training key.
