# How do I use a subscription catalog

Subscription catalogs allow users to browse and take courses available through their subscription, mark a course as a favorite to easily find again, search for specific courses, or take a set of courses on a specific topic through a learning path.

## Subscription catalog features
The Simple course catalogs display as tiles showing a course graphic if one is available, show icons to depict activities in the courses, and have the ability to mark favorites. Courses are shown in alphabetical order, however, any **Featured** courses show first. Filter categories and filters are custom created to allow searches.
