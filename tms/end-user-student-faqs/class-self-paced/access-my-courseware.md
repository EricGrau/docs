# What is the Access Courseware or MS Learn Courseware button and how do I use it?

If you see an **Access Courseware** or an **MS Learn Courseware** button on your class enrollment page, you can use it to easily access your digital courseware. The Access Courseware button opens Skillpipe courseware and the MS Learn Courseware button opens Microsoft Learn courseware. 

To see either courseware button you must be enrolled in a class based on a course with the courseware available. This button only appears after the start time on the first day of class; once class starts, you may have to refresh your page to see it.

## MS Learn Courseware
In a class using an integrated MS Learn course, an MS Learn Courseware button displays for students on the class enrollment details page. 

Click the **MS Learn Courseware** button to access the courseware.

When you click this button the first time, you will be taken to either the **Authorization Request** page or the **Registration** page for Skillpipe. If your TMS account has the same primary email address as your Skillpipe account, on the **Authorization Request** page, you will:
1. Enter your Skillpipe **password**
1. Click **Authorize Access** to authorize **OneLearn TMS** to access to your Skillpipe account.

You will be taken to your bookshelf in your Skillpipe account. Subsequent times when you click **Access Courseware**, you will be taken directly to your Skillpipe bookshelf without having to sign in.

Please note: This feature only allows you to easily access your courseware in your Skillpipe account through single sign-on from the TMS enrollment page. To manage and make changes to you Skillpipe account itself, you will need to use Skillpipe directly.

If your TMS profile email address is not the same as the email aligned to your Skillpipe account, the **Access Courseware** button will take you to Skillpipeâ€™s **Registration** page. 
- If you do not have a Skillpipe account, you can create a new account from the **Registration** page.
- If you already have a Skillpipe account, you can login into you account by selecting the **Already have an account?** option. 
- Once in your Skillpipe account, you can add a course and enter your courseware code to redeem your courseware.
