# What do I do if I forgot my password?

If you are unable to log in because you have forgotten your password, you can reset it through the log in process; the steps will depend upon your authentication provider. After selecting Sign In on the login page, select your method to sign in. Follow the directions in the authentication provider's dialog to reset your password. If you are using a Skillable account, you may request a password reset.
