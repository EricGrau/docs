# Why am I missing my training?

Missing training from your account can be caused by a few circumstances. Before we look into those, please check under **My Transcript** and **My Training** for your training. **My Transcript** holds training which is completed, which can be a course assignment you completed and would like to start over, or a class where your enrollment is marked as complete. **My Training** holds all upcoming or in progress training, as well as any training that is not marked as complete. 

Circumstances that will effect your access to access training are as follows:
* Your training is associated to a different user account, [look here for more information](/tms/end-user-student-faqs/basics/wrong-user-acct.md). Reach out to training organization to verify your training is associated to proper account and if more than one user account exists for you they can merge the accounts for you.
* You received a training key that needs to be redeemed [look here form more information on redeeming training keys](/tms/end-user-student-faqs/class-self-paced/training-key-issues.md).
