# How do I change my username?
Usernames are applied in combination with a password to log into your training account. Some usernames can be customized to help differentiate accounts if you have training on our platform through multiple organizations. By default your username will be the same as the email associated to your training account. 

Due to the effects on your accounts, you may be required to reach out to your training organization to make changes to the username on your account. Check this by editing your user account:

1. In the top right corner of any page, click your **name** to open the user menu and select **Edit Profile**
2. View the **Username** field to see if you can update it, if so, make the change
3. Click **Save**

If the field is not open to be edited, please contact your training organization and provide them with your current account information and the details of the changes you are requesting to be made.
