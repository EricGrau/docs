# How do I use a subscription catalog

Our subscription catalogs allow you to browse available courses within a subscription you have access to. Once in a subscription catalog you can search for course, read course descriptions, find learning paths, mark courses as favorites, and begin training on any course.

## Access subscription catalogs
You can access subscription catalog(s) once you are logged in from your current training page. After you have begun a course or a lab, you can continue it from the current training page or your dashboard.

### My training page
Your training page holds access to all training which is active or not completed. If a course assignment is completed or your enrollment status is marked complete, then that training is moved to your transcript. Any active training like course assignments, labs, and classes can be accessed from your dashboard.
