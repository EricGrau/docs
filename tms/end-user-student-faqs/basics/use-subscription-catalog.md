# How do I use a subscription catalog

Our subscription catalogs allow you to browse available courses within a subscription you have access to. Once in a subscription catalog you can search for course, read course descriptions, find learning paths, mark courses as favorites, and begin training on any course.

Any active training like course assignments and labs can be accessed from your dashboard.

### Filters
Filters in version 2 of our course catalog are effective and save screen space. Any of the filters on the menu can have sub-menus with more filtering options. Filtering works differently from the main menu options to the sub-menu options. Main menu options filter as "AND" meaning all filters selected must match filters assigned to the course for it to appear in the results; while sub-menu options filter as "OR" which shows courses that match at least one matching filter assigned to the course, as opposed to all of them.
