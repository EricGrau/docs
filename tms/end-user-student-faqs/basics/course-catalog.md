# How to use the course catalog

Our Course catalog allows users to browse an organization’s available courses; having a catalog is the organization’s prerogative. The courses can be displayed in three different ways: Find Courses, Simple Course Catalog Version 1, and Simple Course Catalog Version 2. A **Courses** link may appear on the Navigation bar to open the course catalog, however, the name of the link can be changed based on an organization’s preference.
