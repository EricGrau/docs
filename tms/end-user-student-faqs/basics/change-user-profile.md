# How do I access and update my user profile?

Your user profile contains your name, contact information, account executive, time zone, authentication provider, platform roles, organization management, company information and any company you manage. Your name and email address cannot be edited by you.

If you want to change your contact information or any other editable information in your user profile:

1. In the top right corner of any page, click **your name** to open a menu and select **Edit Profile**
1. Revise any field in your user profile and then click **Save**

To change your **name** or update any of your **email addresses**, please contact your training organization with your changes. Be sure to provide them with your account email and details on what to update.
