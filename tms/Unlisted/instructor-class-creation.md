    This is where you will search for the workshop that the class is going to deliver.

1. When searching for a course, it is recommended to **remove existing search filters** and **add the following filter and condition**:
    - Name: Does: Contain
   
   This makes it so that an exact match is not required for the search and will make it easier to find the course you are looking for.

    >[!Knowledge] If you are having trouble finding the workshop using this search, try to search part of the name, such as `Azure SQL Database Essentials` or `WorkshopPLUS`. This will allow you to view more related search results. There may be several results, so narrowing down the search with keywords is helpful.
