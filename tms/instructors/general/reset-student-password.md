To change either the password or username:

1. On the right side of the **Roster** page on the row for the student, click the **Username and Password** icon (looks like a lock). 
1. The Login Credentials: Student dialog opens.
1. Change the **Username** if needed.
1. Check **Change Password** if needed.
    >[!knowledge] Passwords must meet the following complexity requirements: 
    > - 8 characters
    > - 1 number
    > - 1 letter
    > - 1 lower-case letter
    > - 1 special character

    1. Input and confirm the **New Password**.
    1. Click **Save**.

The student will not be notified of the changes. Therefore, please inform them of their new login credentials.
