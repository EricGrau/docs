# What does it mean to be a contract instructor?

A contract instructor is an instructor who is available to work for multiple organizations. Any instructor may choose to be a contract instructor. Any organization using the Skillable TMS that opts in to use contract instructors can search for qualified instructors based on the competencies they have set up, can view some of the contract instructor's contact information, and schedule instructors for their classes.

Organizations that choose to use contract instructors will see contract instructors when they search for instructors on the Find Instructors search page. They will also be able to view your name, email address, phone numbers, city, state, zip code and country listed within your user profile. The organization cannot view the user profile but can pull this information using output options on the Find Instructors page. They cannot see organizations you have taught for or which organization your user account is under in the Skillable TMS.

This allows a contract instructor to discretely teach for multiple organizations. You can access all of your classes for various organizations using the same login credentials; you do not have to have multiple accounts for each organization you are teaching for. Once you are scheduled in the Skillable TMS to teach a class with an organization, you will see the event show up on your instructor calendar. The simplest way to access a class you are teaching is from your instructor calendar. However, best practice is to login from the organization's URL so that when you display your screen it will show the organization's logo. 

We offer access to be a contract instructor and use contract instructors as a convenience for all parties. We do not certify any instructors or verify their qualifications to teach a course. All communication, scheduling, contracted rates and payment are the responsibility of the booking organization and the instructor.

If you would like to opt in to become a contract instructor, you need to enable the setting on your user profile. To access your user profile:
1. From the top right corner of any page, click your name or if available, the expand pick list beside your name and click **View account**. 
1. On your user profile page, click **Edit**. 
1. Open the **Instructor Information** tab, check the box for **Is Contract Instructor**.
1. Click **Save**.
