Today's Sessions contains a tab for each session scheduled for the day listing the class name and session times with a button to copy the class link to your clipboard and a student progress graph.

A donut graph shows the percentage of students' progress on their class activities:
1. Not Started - No activities have been opened
2. In Progress - The percentage of students' activities that have been launched
3. Completed -  The percentage of students' activities that have been completed

## Week at a glance

Week at a glance shows any classes in progress during that week. The class line shows across the duration of the class from start to end date regardless of any days within that time on which the class does not meet. The class bar shows the class time, class name and the number of students enrolled over the total number of seats in the class.

## Month at a glance

The month at a glance outlines the current date, highlights any instructor blockout days in orange, and shows a green dot for each session scheduled on a day. if more sessions are scheduled than can show on the day's space, a half circle displays to show there are additional sessions that cannot be seen. Clicking on a calendar day with sessions lists the date, session times and class names.
