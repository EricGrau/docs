## Overview
Need to update or reset your password? This guide will walk you through the process of changing your Skillable password. We offer two methods to reset your password depending on your login status. If you cannot log in, you can trigger an email with a password reset link. If you are already logged in, you can reset your password directly through your user profile. 

If you have linked your Skillable account with an external authentication provider like Google or Microsoft Live, please note that you cannot reset your password through the Skillable Login Assistance page. Instead, you must follow the password reset process provided by your external authentication provider. This ensures that your authentication and password settings remain synchronized across platforms.

## Password Reset through Email
If you have forgotten your password, you can easily initiate the password reset process through our Login Assistance page. Once login assistance steps are initiated an automated email will be sent to the primary email address provided. This email will contain a password reset link. 

**To request a password reset**
1.	From a Skillable site **login page**, click the **Sign In** button. This opens a page with different sign in options.
2.	Click the **Reset Password** link below the Email or User name field. Alternatively, you can directly access the Login Assistance page by going to your site URL followed by /User/LoginAssistance. For example, https://[yoursitename].learnondemand.net/User/LoginAssistance.
