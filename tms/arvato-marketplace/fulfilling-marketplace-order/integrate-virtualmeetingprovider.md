# How can I add a virtual meeting provider to a class? 

You can easily integrate with the virtual meeting provider of your choice to provide hands-on, interactive virtual training solutions. Integrating a virtual meeting provider with the our platform just takes a few clicks to set-up. You can set up training in the LODS Training Management System (TMS) using your preferred virtual meeting provider in your classes. If you are using Teams, GoToMeeting, Adobe Connect, Zoom or another service, it can be used to give students and instructors access within a class. This will give your instructors and students everything they need for their class by clicking buttons on one page.

## Enter your Meeting URL for your Class 

It quick and easy to set up class access to your virtual meeting provider within a TMS class. All you need is the meeting URL to enter as the Virtual Delivery type when you create a class.

Once it is added your instructors and students will see an Enter Classroom button to access your virtual meeting from their class. When instructors go to their class, they can enter the virtual meeting and they always have access to open their labs.

When students come to their enrollment, they can enter the virtual meeting or open their labs. Clicking the Enter Classroom button directly adds them into the meeting. If the meeting host has not started the meeting, they need to wait for the meeting to begin. The launch buttons for labs and course activities appear when class begins.
