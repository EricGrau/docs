## Contribute to Skillable technical documentation
We welcome contributions from our community as well as from Skillable employees from outside the documentation teams. How you contribute depends on who you are and the sort of changes you'd like to contribute:

* **Community - minor updates**: If you are contributing minor updates, you can find the article in this repository using the search field, or by navigating to [Skillable Studio](https://labondemand.com) or our [Training Management System](https://lms.learnondemand.net), clicking the **Help** button at the top of the window, navigating to the help documentation that you want to contribute to, and then clicking the **Edit** button in the Integrated Help client. Then, use the GitHub UI to make your updates. Or, you are welcome to fork the repository and submit updates from your fork.

* **Community - new articles + major changes**: If you're part of the Skillable Studio or Training Management System communities and you want to create a new article or submit major changes, please submit an issue to start a conversation with the documentation team. Once you've agreed to a plan, you'll need to work with an employee to help bring that new content in through work in the public repository. 

## Tools and setup
Community contributors can use the GitHub UI or fork the repo to contribute. 

## Repository organization
The content in the docs repository is broken into two root folders:

### \Skillable Studio
The *\Skillable Studio* folder contains the documentation for **Skillable Studio**, formatted as Markdown files with an *.md* extension.

### \tms
The *\tms* folder contains the documentation for our **Training Management System**, formatted as Markdown files with an *.md* extension.

## How to use markdown to format your topic
All the articles in this repository use idl-md, our internal flavor of Markdown that is based on GitHub flavored markdown, with a few extensions specific to our platform. If you are not familiar with Markdown or idl-md, see:
